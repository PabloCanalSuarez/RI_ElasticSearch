selftext: This is a personal reminder, but also a way to participate on this reddit which I sometimes read in the past whenever I wanted to quit. 

I'm 26, my first cig was when I was 12, my grand-parents and parents are all smokers, including most uncles and aunts. I was smoking nearly a pack a day (about 15-20 a day, sometimes more if I drank alcohol). I'm also asthmatic.

The longest I quit was 1 month, but then I went to see my family (I've been living a little far away from them now) and when I saw everyone smoking in the house, smelling cigarettes, seeing cigarettes everywhere, I could not resist, I had a weakness. I told myself "just one or two...". Then "just while i'm staying here" and then it was too late, I went back to smoking nearly a pack a day. 

Reaons for quiting again : caughing muccus every morning which makes me gag and want to vomit everytime. Being out of breath with the smallest exercices, i'm going to travel 2 weeks and doing alot of hiking and I want to be in better shape for it, I'm going on a date with a very smart, nice and beautiful girl who is also very healthy and I want to do activities with her, and I do not want to be a slave to nicotine anymore.

It's 1 A.M at my place right now, i'm working at 8:30 A.M and I can't sleep, i'm craving for a cigarette. But i'm going to stay strong.

selftext: I'm into week 2 and REALLY struggling with a huge crave. It's been building the last couple days and today it's almost unbearable.

I just can't stop thinking about just going, getting a pack, smoking 1 and then restarting the stop.

Now logically I know this is BS and just my mind telling me to give in, and the cycle begins again.

However, right now I just can't cope. Does having a nicotine mint reset my quit counter? Would this make me more likely to start smoking again as I'm putting more nicotine back into my body?

selftext: Hey, everyone. I’m on day 4 of my quit and I have been using a low nicotine vape as a bit of a crutch to help with me getting through this. (2 pack a day smoker) 
I’m sure most of you have experienced the coughing and hacking up of mucus and all sorts of goodness from your chest throughout your time smoking.
I’m still experiencing this lightly and I’m curious if I should blame the vape or is this just residual effects from my smoking as I’ve only been off the cigs for 4 days.

selftext: 10 year smoker here, I quit again 4 days ago and it's never gone this well before. For the first time in my life, I'm certain I can do this. I've tried to quit in a serious way 4 times, but in the back of my mind I always knew I hadn't smoked my last cigarette. No matter how much I hated my habit. The thing I loathe the most about smoking is waking up to my stinky cigarette hand next to my face on my pillow after a long night of drinking. Absolutely the most disgusting thing on this planet. Drinking has always been my downfall with cigarettes. I lose all sense of willpower, and wake up with a horrible nicotine hangover every time. 

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to quit cold turkey and lasted about a month and before I began sneaking cigs on my nights out. I tried the patch because I heard it would put so much nicotine in my system that smoking would make me sick. It just gave me panic attacks and heart palpitations. I tried gum. I hated the spicy burn it had, and I often still wanted a cigarette an hour later when the gum buzz wore off. I tried vaping and it was expensive, leaky, dorky looking, a pain in the ass to keep charged, and just didn't give me that back of the throat hit I craved. Often I would find myself more addicted to nicotine than with my usual smoking habit, and went back to my American spirits with a furious apatite, smoking twice what I used to for a month or so.

&amp;nbsp;

The thing that finally changed for me, and it feels like cheating, is I found something I like even more than cigarettes. Something even more addictive and satisfying, and it scares me a little. I got a Juul.

&amp;nbsp;

It hits the back of my throat and my brain in a way no other vape ever has. In a way only that first smoke of the day can. Two hits and I'm swimming in an instant delicious nicotine head rush. It charges so fast (under an hour), doesn't have a bunch of parts to maintain, and warns me when it's running low on battery so it doesn't crap out on me at the bar. The battery lasts exactly as long as one pod so it takes the most minimal effort to keep it running. It hits perfectly every time and tastes amazing. I can use it almost anywhere because it is so small and discrete and the smell doesn't hang in the air. I don't feel self conscious using it in public. And it might be cheaper than my smoking habit, though we'll see. I'm obsessed with this thing. But I also feel like it has me hooked on nicotine on a whole new level. And I'm a little scared. 

&amp;nbsp;

It only took me 3 days to go through a pod, and one pod is supposed to be equivalent to a whole pack of cigarettes. I was rarely more than a pack a week smoker, unless I was having a serious party weekend, and most of those were bummed out to friends. I find myself wanting to hit it all the time. But I haven't wanted a cigarette even once. Not last night when I was drinking red wine with a bunch of my smoker roommates on the porch. Not this morning with my cup of coffee. Not after the big greasy burger I had for lunch. Not during my long drive home from work. Not while I was doing my homework on a heavy dose of Adderall. Not when I was feeling kinda gassy crampy and constipated and needed a little help taking a nice big shit. My Juul has me covered. 

&amp;nbsp;

I love it. I love it so much it worries me. They don't make lower concentration pods, and they definitely don't make nicotine free pods. Their juice contains nicotine salts instead of freebase nicotine like most e liquids, and this shit is like crack. Whoever created Juul knows what they are doing. I am subscribed to their monthly delivery of pods and completely beholden to them. But at least I'm not smoking. So long as I have this thing in my pocket, I know I won't ever smoke another cigarette again. I've never felt this certain I was done in my life. I guess I should be happy, but moving on to what feels like a much stronger addiction was not what I had in mind...

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: I got a Juul and finally found something I like more than cigarettes. Too bad it is it's crazy addictive and I've tripled my nicotine intake.

selftext: I have read tons of online material about preparing, have taken the steps a few times in the past, but the only thing I've left out previously is letting people know my intentions. Each and every time I have set a date in the past year or so, it's been too easy to put it off, simply because of this step. 

This time I'm announcing it (have already told a few people, got a currently smoking quit buddy, and a wealth of advice from an ex smoker who's also helping). 

Additionally...I've rid my space of ashtrays, any old packs, anything associated with smoking, and am destroying my last pack before I go to bed tonight. I've got a list of what to do in the event of triggers, and have some tea tree/mint toothpicks, along with some carrot sticks, for the first week or two. 

No nicotine replacement - tried a few different ones, did not like them. Plus, I want to just get the nicotine out of my system and move on from smoking. 

Any advice for how to hang in there for the first day, three days, week?

selftext: (Sorry in advance for the rambling and any formatting issues. I'm finding that writing this stuff down helps me figure out ways to help myself, and if I'm honest, internet stranger support is pretty swell too.)

I've haven't had a cigarette for 6 days, though I've had two puffs of my boyfriend's 3 days ago. The vape is the only reason I haven't gone and bought a pack. I started at 6mg for the nicotine, and it has been the perfect amount to shut my brain up when I get cravings. It also helps with the hand to mouth feeling that is a major part of my addiction, so on my break I go out to vape because I don't know what to do on breaks besides smoke. 

Today I forgot it and was so upset and didn't know what I was going to do on my break, or how grumpy I was going to be, but I told myself I wasn't going to bum one. I even told the other smokers as soon as I realized to not give me one if I asked. 

First half of my break I went to the Tim Hortons near my work and then to the bathroom, and didn't get any major cravings. So that was good. Second half of my break I went and stood outside for a bit, and took another bathroom break to avoid being too bored (which triggers cravings real bad for me), and I made it through that without major anger. It helped that my coworkers are amazingly supportive, and even some customers who heard I was quitting were super supportive.

The biggest test for me was busing home. Having nothing else to do makes me crave a smoke something awful, so waiting for the bus and walking places is when a lot of my smoking would happen. I discovered that listening to music with a really heavy bassline to it helps, because the tapping of my foot gave me something to focus on.

I'm so pleased with myself, I managed to go without nicotine for a long ass time by my standards, and I didn't immediately run for my vape when I got home!

I honestly didn't think I'd be able to make it this far, yet here I am. If I can do it, anyone can!

selftext: I’m 19 years old and no one knows I smoke. I smoke around 5-6 cigarettes a day in private, not letting anyone see me. I feel awful about this I’m ashamed that I’m a smoker and I feel if I tell anyone now they’ll never forgive me for withholding the truth for so long. I am constantly at war with myself. I have admitted it to no one but myself, but I am a smoker. I’ve been smoking for two years and have said “this is my last pack” and made a feeble attempt at quitting more times than I can count. I struggle because no one knows about my dirty habit, so I am free from any external judgement if I go pick up a pack and smoke them - which is making cravings very hard. I know I am an awful person for the way I handled my smoking. This is the longest I’ve gone in a long time and my most successful attempt as quitting; I just passed the 48 hour mark. 

I’m having a hard time and need the support, so I felt the need to write something somewhere.

selftext: I'm 22.  Figure now's the right time to stop. Started a few years ago casually. As a 'social smoker'. Eventually started buying my own packs, smoking alone and at this point I suck down 4 to 6 a day.  Sometimes to deal with stress, sometimes from habit, sometimes just cause I'm already outside so may as well.  I've definitely consistently owned a pack of cigs for a year now.  
I tried cold turkey a few months back and couldn't do it.  I went through two rough days and a sweaty, shivering, sleepless night but I cracked at the end of day two.    

I'm trying something new this time.  I got a cheap vape and medium level nicotine juice.  Gonna work that for a week and switch to lower nicotine.  After that I'll switch to zero-nicotine juice and just hit the thing for taste--I figure that might make it easier.  

I gotta do this now.  I've just finished college and got a few weeks before I start work and being a 'real adult'. I'm young but I've already felt the side effects...being winded after a flight of stairs, feeling short of breath etc.  I've got some low-stress weeks coming up so there's no better time on the horizon.  I got my vape to keep it easy and have been careful not to hit it like crazy and I got a plan to cut down.  
Back when I first started smoking the lie I told myself was that it was fine cause I was young.  Just being a dumb kid.  Well, here I am about to enter the real world so it's now or never.  I'm done.  I'm done denying that I'm somehow not addicted.  I'm done caving to the pressure. I'm done lying to myself I could quit any time. 

I've been off cigs for two days now, using my vape to curb the cravings when I start going nuts.  It's been bad at times but no where near as bad as cold turkey.  I got this. Small steps.  

Thanks for reading if you've read this far. Just figured I'd share.  I got friends supporting me but none of them smoke so it's not the same.  If anyone's got tips on how not to get hooked on the vape I wouldn't mind hearing those either I guess.

selftext: This Sub is the absolute bee's knees Y'all. I am super grateful. I discovered it last week when I decided in the moment to quit again. I was an off and on again smoker for about ten years, alternating between a pack a day to a pack a week to vaping to smoking black 'n milds when I thought it would be okay. They are fucking gross. It all stinks, and vaping increases your douchiness by a full degree of magnitude. 

I come here sometimes to ride out a craving. Also, been doing sets of 12-20 pushups or jumping jacks to help with dopamine. Today I actually feel productive at work and able to focus. 

I am not a smoker, and you all helped me reach that. Thank you!!!

selftext: Hi all, this is my first post here (though I’ve been lurking for a couple of days)


I decided to try and quit again. Long story short, I quit smoking cigarettes back in around about October 2017. I switched to vaping and eventually quit that altogether too.


Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago and I’m currently staying with my partner and his family (We’re in a long distance relationship) and I hadn’t touched a cigarette since I quit. Problem is, his family are smokers, so the cravings became really strong and I gave in and bought a pack. A few days later I came clean to my partner about it knowing he’d be (understandably) disappointed. But he handled it well, said everyone makes mistakes, and we came to an agreement that I could smoke until his parents come back from their mini-break (3 days in the Netherlands) then I gotta pack it in for good. I agreed and promised that I would. 


On the day they return I kept my word and gave what was left of my pack to my partners older brother &amp; that was that. 


I haven’t gave in again yet but the cravings are becoming stronger and stronger and I don’t know how best to deal with them without resorting to vaping/other products, but I know that if I go onto anything else I’ll crave the real thing again so I’m kinda just going cold turkey. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks for reading

selftext: Im six months smoke free after a 15 year pack a day addiction.  Overall feeling a lot better, cravings are still there but they are manageable.  I'm still having trouble with long term exercising and have gotten "smokers flu"/chest cold a couple times, most recently this week.  Any one else experience this? I thought that six months clean, I shouldn't be experiencing "smokers flu" this far into quitting.  And wondering for those who exercise, how long it took to build your wind/endurance back up.  Many thanks!

selftext: I know this is a newb question, but I need that kick up the ass to stick to vaping. I smoke about 5 packs a week. About 8 packs if I was drinking (quit drinking for good because of gallbladder removal). 

I'm getting 20 mg nicotine salts tomorrow because even 12mg has had a huge impact on cravings. I had four cigarettes today because walking around the town for hours and taking photos is how I keep active. I'm easily clocking 8 miles a day so I've always justified the smoking with cognitive dissonance by saying at least I was getting exercise. If I didn't have enough money for smokes I wouldn't even bother walking around that much tbh... 

I want kids and a long life. I look young for my age right now and don't have any wrinkles + my parents have aged well. I put sun factor 50 screen on everyday and moisturise every night but still smoke?? I already have asthma and have gotten pneumonia three times in the past 2 years. 

Is 8 years too much damage to bounce back from?

selftext: First of all, I want to say thank you to the people who took some of their time to encourage me, even if it were just a few words. Also, good job for the words of encouragement you also give to other people!

I wanted to share some thoughts I had, if it can help anyone or have some positive effect, then mission accomplished!

-First : I quit cold turkey and had no date or time planned. I did that in the past and always failed except for once for 1 month, then I fked up and smoke again. What's different this time? After the 3rd day, i'm not craving a cig anymore, i'm not fighting an impulse, not having a debate between two voices in my head (one saying smoke and the other saying quit).

-2 : I think i'm not craving anymore because I had a big realisation : most of the cigarettes I smoked were not only not enjoyed, but I smoked them out of habit. These last few months I really started to hate smoking, everything about it. When I bought my last pack, I enjoyed my first cigarette because I tried and fail to quit. But I swear to god, the 24 cigarettes after were out of habit and not in relation to a craving or even a strong desire to smoke : the first cig of the morning, the cig after eating, the ones on my breaks at the job, the one after the job and during the ride back to my place, and the one before going to bed. After I realised this, I felt even more disgust with smoking and my weaknesses.

-3 : after the 2nd day, no more cravings because I changed my mindset. I'm not sacrificing something when I stop smoking. Because I realised that I mainly smoked out of habit, it did not feel so hard to resist that few seconds of wanting nicotine. It's the opposite : I'm making sacrifices WHEN I'M SMOKING. Sacrificing my health, my money, my time, my freedom, my attractiveness. 

I hope these things were at least interesting to read for some of you. Stay strong everyone, we can do it!

selftext: Maybe I am addicted and I don't want to belittle anyone's struggle. I'm a casual smoker. Not a social smoker but a casual smoker. The reason I started smoking was because my first high school job as a dishwasher you got "smoke breaks" on top of your regular breaks if you were a smoker. I kept up the habit. But I only smoke at work and while driving. I think it's a boredom thing. If I'm home for the weekend I won't smoke at all or if I'm with friends or family I never need to go for a smoke. Just smoking at work and driving I smoke about 2-3 packs a week and winter I smoke 2-3 packs a month.

I think it would be easy to quit. It's unhealthy and its a waste of money. But at the same time I can't imagine what to do on work breaks or what I would do while driving. A big part of not wanting to quit if it's just almost a part of my idenity now. Anyone quit who was just a casual smoker but struggled to quit? What helped you?

And I am now eating more to replace my habit. Is there a non nicotine alternative like an e -cig of some sort that I can just puff on but doesn’t have all the yucky stuff in it?

selftext: This is a long post anyone who has used NRT aids at all id appreciate your advice. All the info I find is from the companies that make them and it seems like they want you to use them as long as possible and theyre quite expensive.

Been just under a pack a day going on 10 years with no real attempts to quit. I have switched to some fancy ‘additive free’ roll your own smoke for the last month it attempt to ween myself off. 

Doing the math I was smoking 15 a day with each cigarette being .8g of tobacco. The roll your own pouches are 50g of tobacco and one lasts we two weeks roughly. For the cigarettes it was 15 a day x 14 days = 210 smokes in 2 weeks. 210 x . 8 = 168g of tobacco in two weeks / 14 is 12g of tobacco a day.

For roll your own its 50g / 14 days = 3.5g of tobacco a day. So I am smoking a third of the tobacco I was presently and havent noticed any major negative feelings. I have read you get 1mg of nicotine per cigarette meaning I was getting 15mg a day previously and 4mg a day this last month roughly.

Based on this I bought my NRT aids. I see they are in 3 steps 21mg 14mg and 7mg over 24hr. Smokers over 10 a day do 21mg and under 10 do 14mg. Tapering down to 7mg eventually. So with this in mind I only bought step 3 which is 7mg over 24hr as ive only been smoking the equivalent of 3-4 smokes a day. 

Ideally id cold turkey but its just not something I can deal with now. However I do not want to be on any prolonged NRT. So I bought a pack of 7mg patches and 2mg gums. I feel going on the 14mg over 24hr patch would be increasing my nicotine intake which defeats the point.

 Basically my plan is 1 week of 7mg patches then chew a couple pieces  of 2mg gum a day for 4mg nic a day then down to one piece 2mg a day then no gum. I have experience with addiction and im treating this one with the same quick taper mindset.

So basically im wondering if I am totally naive and uninformed as to how NRT works and my plan. I know its going to take more than just NRT and getting off nicotine to quit for good but I just need help with the nicotine withdrawal aspect.

Either way tomorrow morning I will be putting that first 7mg patch on and hoping I can kick this nasty wasteful habit and get closer to a more healthy life!

Thanks for reading :)

selftext: This is the first time I've posted here. I don't really know what to write as I've tried and failed over the last 3 years so many times. Where do I start???

Some background is that I quit smoking around 13 years ago for 10 YEARS. How did I start again? Well all it took was a week away on holiday, few few drinks to be social every night, then the odd cigarette just with a beer, turned into buying a pack to smoke the next day. I WAS HOOKED AGAIN.

I quickly switched to an E-cig, thinking I'll be able to get off these easily. But little did I know it has been far harder that coming off normal cigarettes. 

For the last 3 I've  been going between using patches and  E-cigs. I have had a month smoke free at best, but I always fail.

The trouble is that I can always just think it's just one wee E-cig to get my through that hour. I can smoke and my wife won't find out, I seek away too the shops and smoke and there is no smell. But I'm still totally hooked on nicotine and get the relief from a craving.

I seem to get so depressed after about 2 weeks and smoke again. It causes a lot a trouble with my wife as the see's that I'm never getting of the patches. I always causes arguments when she asks how it is going. 

I'm 4 days now smoke free. I'm finding this the hardest 4 days trying to quit. Maybe because I know this is my last chance to quit before I start a new job with lower wages, so I don't want to waste money on my nicotine addiction. 

Sorry for the long post

selftext: I stopped smoking cigarettes in January, and moved to vaping. It wasn't hard at all. I lost my vape stick a few days ago and managed to get through one whole day without nicotine \(my head was pulsing all day\), but I've since bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked 5 in the last 2 days.

I don't want to start smoking again, and I don't want to have a crutch anymore, but I have serious exams coming up in 2 weeks, and I'm afraid the side effects of quitting nicotine cold\-turkey will impact how I do.

I'm also afraid that I'm only telling myself that because I don't want to quit, and that if I do bad in exams and I did quit smoking at the same time, I'd just blame the poor results on quitting.

selftext: I was damn sure I'd never smoke again. I barely thought about cigarettes, barely had cravings and was disgusted by the smell. I got through two plus years smoke free...

Then I went on holiday 2 weeks ago and was in a country where I was surrounded by it 24/7, with cheap prices to boot. I caved whilst drinking then let myself smoke for the remainder of the trip. I smoked for about 10 days in total, some days 1 or 2, some days 10 depending if I was drinking. 

Anyway I'm back and I've completely stopped again, don't feel the desire for one at all. I'm adamant that I will not continue this at home. But this experience really broke me as person... If I could let this slip after 2 years when my guard was down for two seconds, what else could happen?

Does anyone also know if quitting this time will be less intense than two years ago when I was a full time pack a day smoker? I sure hope it is, especially since I already don't feel any cravings at all really, but I'm still scared somehow I'll let myself slip.

selftext: Hey Reddit. 

A bit of back story. I've smoked since I was 15. Over 20 years. Pack and a half a day. 
I was a couch potato for my twenties and started exercising in my 30s. I've tried to give up smoking on average once or twice a year for the last ten years. This time it's different. 

My dad got news about lung cancer last Christmas. He smoked a pipe all his life. I'm not going to describe what he is going through, what he looks like or the effect this is having on us all. Imagine it yourselves and now double it. 

I have not had a cigarette in two months. The want for one is nearly gone. My trigger was always alcohol. Always. My will power went out the window when I had pints. So anyway this is what helped me. 

•Stop drinking for at least a month

•Exercise - walk, run, anything at all

•Get outside and get some air into your new lungs

•Reward yourself after a set amount of time - buy yourself something 

•Change your eating habits, you will be hungry for a time - use this to eat healthy

•The first three days are the hardest with day two the worst for me

•The pain passes, It honestly does

•Drink plenty of water

•YOU CAN DO THIS

•When you finally go for a drink put yourself in a place you can leave if you want and preferably with non smokers

•The cravings go away in five minutes

•The craving strength lessens over time

•The number of cravings reduce to nearly nothing over time

•Distract yourself when you want one, take up a new hobby - paint, knit, sow, draw, run, swim, surf, climb, board games, make models, learn a new language, learn a new skill, take on a project. 

While two months is not that long a time I genuinely feel I have broken the back on this. I'm not allowing myself to say I'm a non smoker. I think I will be a smoker for the rest of my life but I will be one who doesn't smoke. I am not going to allow myself to become complacent - I have fallen into that trap before. 

So take my word for it. I see my dad now and no one wants that. Currently you are throwing money away in order to hurt yourself and feed a pointless need. 

If I told you to pay me to give you a pin so you could prick yourself you would call me mad. That's what you are doing for nicotine.. paying someone so you can hurt yourself. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Again I'm here with my dad with tubes in places (we made a joke of counting them earlier) that no one should. Don't be that and dont be someone who becomes that. Please, for you.

I've had casual patio drinks and way too many campfire drinks and been clubbing and camping and hiking and to the beach. I've seen my non-smoking parents and chain-smoking friends and spent days without seeing anyone at all. I feel like I've hit every trigger possible at this point, but now, six weeks in, I've been getting the worst cravings of my entire quit.

I don't feel like my life has actually changed much since my quit, except that I'm maybe a little happier and a bit less smelly. I do have more free time, as I'm not wasting 5 min x 15 cigarettes a day (an hour and 15 minutes every day, over 55 HOURS in the last 6 weeks), but really that just gets folded into other tasks. I've spent my new found non-smoker wealth on upgrading my hiking gear. Life is, ostensibly, NORMAL. So WHY NOW?

What is it about NOW, after all of this, that is making me want to cave and buy a pack? I've been thinking about it non-stop for days. There are supposed to be no triggers left! Tell me I'm an idiot, please!

selftext: Hi there. 31/yo pack plus a few a day smoker for 10(ish) years. 

I'm going to have gastric bypass surgery and needed to quit smoking. I bought a vape and a bottle of 12mg nic. But that was too strong. So i bought a bottle of 3mg nic... and that wasnt enough. Ive been mixing. 

The plan is to ween off of nicotine for awhile... and then ween off the vape. 

I'm surprised at how well ive been doing. The vape has been a godsend. I work in a bar 6 nights a week... and cigarettes are EVERYWHERE. i haven't caved. And only had an emotional breakdown once. 

However... everyone keeps scaring me saying that vaping is way more dangerous than cigarettes. Popcorn lung... pneumonia... etc. Etc. Ive looked it up on the google machine... and i cant find sources to tell me if im worse off vaping than smoking. 

I see that many people in this sub use(d) vapes... did any of you get horrible lung issues? Or pneumonia? 

Glad i found this sub! Thanks in advance!

selftext: So, I've been down to a single cigarette per day for a long time now.  It's always a struggle to keep it to that one, but I generally manage unless there is alcohol involved.  I just don't know how to get rid of that last cigarette!

Sometimes I can even go a week without a cigarette, but eventually the cravings catch up with me and I wind up buying a pack.

Sometimes I feel like I'm going to constantly be fighting with this.  Will there always be cravings?  I don't even think it's just nicotine.  I actually enjoy the act of smoking.

Honestly, I'm posting because I'm not sure what to do at this point and am very frustrated.

selftext: I quit for a full year in 2014, but with an e-cig. 

In 2016 I quit for a solid 6 months, cold turkey. It was great. How did I start up again? Gradually, bumming off coworkers, then bumming so much I graduated to buying them packs....then that spilled into buying packs again. Within a week I am back to a pack a day. 

Have a great Christmas this year and started 2018 with no cigs. Lasted a month, and within 2 days of smoking again, I am back at a pack a day. 

Now my intake has increased even more, I'm smoking more than ever, I can feel it destroying my lungs. I want to quit so bad yet, at the same time, feel I have the lowest motivation to quit. I don't want to go through it again. I know all about it, after about the 10th day of cold turkey things really start improving. But then at some point I inevitably fall back into it. It seems hopeless and worthless. I am disgusted by them and love them at the same time. I want to quit and be done with them forever yet still want to be a smoker. 

I am stuck. 

Edit: started at 18, it has been 8 years of smoking. I can't believe I have been a smoker my entire adult life. I don't want to wake up at 30 and still be smoking. Hell I don't want to hit the 10 year mark. Sometimes I feel the damage has already been done so why quit anyway.

selftext: I'm on day five of quitting, and still going strong. My doctor originally prescribed me some nicotine patches to help me with cravings. Since I had been smoking about 2 packs or more a day he put me on the highest dosage of 21  mgs. First day was fine, but then I noticed the past several days my heart beat would be racing a million beats every night and I always felt winded. Then I started getting these really awful pains that would come in spasms starting in the left side of my back, to the frnt of the left chest. Sometime feeling like they were just within my chest, rather than front or back. They were very similar to the cardiovascular related pains I've felt with other drugs. I'm hoping at least it is that, and not lung cancer developing right when I am ready to kick the habit. Though it would be darkly humorous. 

Has anyone experienced these symptoms with patches? Should I try cutting them in half and only wearing a smaller strip of them? Or even 1/4th of one? 

I'm actually typing this now to fight a craving, but it's passed now so I'm good. But I'm just hoping I don't have cancer or something.

selftext: Friday, May 11, 2018, will be my 14th smokefree birthday.   

Not a single bit of nicotine in 14 years. 

If I can do this, you can too. 

I was utterly hopeless.  I was to the point where I hated smoking.  Hated hated hated it.  Hated myself for doing it.   But smoking, and hating it, and hating myself, was "easier" and "less painful" than a few days of discomfort and some understanding how your body's addiction worked, and how it can be broken.  

Until that one day.  May 11, 2004.   Three months shy of 36 years old.    In my car.  Smoking a last cigarette, from a pack I'd just bought.  I just *had* to go out and get a pack.  I *need* that pack.  *Need* it.  

Driving back home and polluting my lungs, I finally thought it. 

"I'm sick of this shit."

I'm sick of my addiction controlling me.  I'm sick of having to smoke. I'm sick of needing this.  I'm sick of the lost money. I'm sick of my wife, my friends and my kid frowning at me because I smell so bad.  I'm sick of hiding this from people.  I'm sick of going to such lengths to smoke and then hide it.  I'm sick of hacking up my lungs in the morning.  I'm sick of getting winded walking up half a flight of stairs.  I'm sick of getting bronchitis every year for 15 years now.   

I'm' sick of quitting and starting, quitting and starting, quitting and failing. I'm sick of getting 3 or 4 days under my belt and then giving in and smoking.  I'm sick of getting juuuust over that hump and then going back.   This is crazy.

I'm sick of this shit.   

I tossed the pack away.  I went home.  I went to bed.  

The next day I shoved nicotine gum in my mouth and suffered through 2 days of intense physical withdrawal with the gum just taking the edge off. 

Day 3 was better.  Day 4 was even better.   Day 5 was OK. 

I got rid of the gum on day 10.  

Day 11 was tough.

Day 12 was OK. 

Day 13 was GREAT.   

Not a cigarette since then.  

You can do this.  YOU CAN DO THIS.

selftext: After many previous quit attempts that lasted from weeks to months, but always resulted in a return to the ole ciggies, I've switched to vaping. I had been smoking a pack a day (for 23 years or so), so started on 18mg nicotine. Am down to 12mg after just 2-3 weeks, and finding it fine. Liking the taste of vaping much more than cigarettes, and although it most likely isn't *harmless*, it's definitely a *better* option than what I was doing. 

I plan to slowly move down to 0 nicotine and eventually off it altogether. Keen to hear others' experiences with this.

I know not everyone in this sub thinks this is a "valid" way to quit smoking, but please keep the comments helpful. Whatever works for you, I say. Thanks.

selftext: I was doing NRT (lozenges) to quit.  I *did* quit, with patches, for 7 years a while back.  But I slip often.  I have a lozenge, spit it out, smoke, then pop a lozenge again.  It's been happening more and more often, and it's only making life worse.  Now, I get anxious unless I have a steady supply of nicotine, all day.  I'm just on the edge of being a chain-smoker on the weekends.  I've kinda dug myself deeper into the nicotine-addiction hole while trying to claw out of it.  So..  I'm done.

I have a stack of Allen Carr books.  I've read them.  I'm on EasyWay ths morning.  You can't get off heroin by shooting more heroin.  Nicotine?  It's been real.  Alcohol?  Ciao.  I'm done, today.

selftext: 32 days quit- cold turkey, no NRT.  Smoked a pack a day for almost 15 years and never tried to stop. Told myself that I had to give quitting a real effort- if I failed, I could at least say I tried when nagged about my habit. I expected to fail. 
32 days later and for the first time I woke up and smoking wasn’t the first thing on my mind. 

Things that helped- 

1.. healthy Competition and social support. Husband quit at the same time. told him I couldn’t quit unless he didn’t smoke around me, and he opted to quit too. I am so grateful, and if he wanted to start again I think I’m strong enough to maintain my quit anyway, but I think he is happy to have quit and hopefully stays quit for himself. Good friend also quit around the same time and it was nice to have people around who understood what I was going through. 
2. Promised myself I would complete the following list in order before giving into a craving:
        Drink a glass of water
        1 lap around the block 
        Take a shower 
        Chew a piece of nicotine gum 
        Buy and use an e-cig
I never made it past walk around the block- by the time I was done with that the craving had passed. 
3. Ate a lot. Ive gained 6 lbs, but I joined Weight Watchers today and am hopeful I can at least stop gaining. A few extra pounds was worth it and snacks definitely helped me fight cravings 
4. Avoided things that would trigger me like drinking until I felt more confident. I was already so uncomfortable those first couple of weeks- why make it worse? 
5. Reminding myself that resisting cravings makes me stronger, and the only thing another cig will do for me is make me want another cig. 
6. Made a list of all the good things I had to gain from quitting and referred to it often.
7. Went easy on myself. During this process I’ve snapped at my husband unnecessarily several times, eaten too much unhealthy food, and abandoned chores for several days. But I quit, and that’s awesome. It’s okay to not be perfect while you quit, just don’t smoke. 
8. I tried to acknowledge but then purposefully ignore the ridiculous things my addict brain came up with- like “I’m going smoke anyway, might as well be now” or “if I’m going to feel miserable, what’s the point?” I was truly my own worst enemy. I don’t view cigarettes as evil- but that addicted part of me that tried to sabotage myself? Yeah- she’s the worst. 


I am so happy to say “I don’t smoke.” I never want to feel the extreme discomfort of needing a cigarette again. The first day without cigarettes I cried, and I continued to grieve for quite awhile. But I stuck it out and am really proud of myself. You deserve this feeling too. Good luck to all.

selftext: I’ve been on nicotine patches for 45 days and scaled down the dosage as instructed.  Yesterday I went patch free and the cravings are a bit stronger now.  Had a dream last night about smoking and woke up thinking for a second that I would go outside and have a wake up smoke.  It was only a second before I remembered I’m a nonsmoker.   The fact that my subconscious forgot that fact concerned me.  There’s been a few moments where I feel a bit panic stricken.  I do feel that my practice in overcoming the psychological cravings first while using the patch is helping me go through now final physical withdrawals and remain strong.  The cravings so far are a bit stronger than anticipated and this last day has been harder than I thought .  Oh well 2 days to go before the nicotine is completely expelled from my body.  Wish me luck!  I’m sticking to my quit.

selftext: TLDR at bottom 

Yeah, my body is addicted to nicotine. I stopped smoking about 6 months ago, and took up vaping instead. The plan was to keep reducing the nicotine until it was at 0, then stop altogether. 

I've almost reduced the nic to 0, im at 2 right now. It doesn't even feel like I'm craving the nicotine. There will be times when I'm stressed and I sit there and vape and vape and vape until I'm sick from nicotine. Even after I'm nic-sick, I have the urge to keep vaping. I don't want nicotine and the thought of it makes me sick in these times, yet I still have a horrible urge to vape or smoke. 


Does anyone else relate? I feel like that's the only thing holding me back from quitting vaping. 

TLDR: even when I'm sick from nicotine I still feel the need to vape , even when the thought of nic makes me sick. Anyone else relate? It's the only thing holding me back.

selftext: I realized some time not that long ago that I've been a smoker for half of my life, I started when I was 17 and now I'm 34.  Every time I light I cigarette, I feel miserable about it and pretty much just hate myself.  I bought a vape last year to try and make the switch to something "healthier" but I ended up just using that on top of smoking.  I'd go a few days with no cigarettes and feel really great about it, and then I would find something to stress about and go out and buy a pack.  

I've spent so much time in smoking rooms in international airports, covered in the stink of twenty different kinds of smokes, huddled outside in the cold after a nice dinner, rushing away from the table to get a cig after drinks, and pretending that smoking was an enjoyable part of my morning coffee/contemplation ritual.  

I've had a lot of false starts over the years, I've gone two weeks, I've gone a month at my longest, but I always come back to it.  

Tomorrow will be my first day as a non\-smoker/non\-nicotine user.  Today, I feel like I'm finally ready to wrestle control from this disgusting habit and take my lungs back.  I keep telling myself that it's not about what I'll be giving up, but about what I'll get from doing this.  I don't want lung cancer, I don't want to develop some sort of heart disease, I don't want to reek of of smoke, or stand in smoke filled glass cages desperately sucking on the end of a cigarette because I can't handle a nine hour plane ride and a layover. I don want to keep telling my  six year old nephew that someday I'll quit when he asks me why I do something that's so unhealthy. 

I'm feeling determined.

Here's hoping I can see this through.

selftext: Just as the title says, I only really crave cigarettes when I drink alcohol. Lowered inhibitions cause me to buy a pack, and then I just smoke them throughout the week. By the time the next weekend rolls around, I'm out of cigarettes again, and I inevitably buy another pack. Also somewhat hurts that a lot of my friends smoke, so there's always cigarettes around.

Anyone have any experience with this sort of cycle? I'm really ready to quit, I just need strategies to combat cravings when I drink.

selftext: TL;DR: So far so good, noticing a range of effects. 

I would like to document my progress with Chantix and share it. If you guys are interested I'll answer questions and post updates. This is kind of long. Mostly about the drug, relevant background info about me is at the end. 

I'm currently starting my second week. This is day 1 of full dose and no cigarettes. 

Week 1 was mostly uneventful. During Week 1 I was allowed to smoke, and the dosage gradually increased.

First I'll go over the side effects. I had some oddly vivid dreams on Day 6. Slightly more vivid and memorable than usual. The kind that you still remember a few days later. Nothing major, first one was kinda sexual, second one was kinda violent. I was an observer, not a participant. I remembered more detail than usual and the content was interesting and a little disturbing, but these definitely were not nightmares. 

As for the desired effect, it's working very well. After a few days I started to lose interest in cigarrettes. On Day 4 I stayed up late drinking and smoked a pack (probably close to 2 total that day, plus vaping). The next day I only had 3 cigarettes. I smoked no more than 5 a day on the remaining two days. Today I've had zero, with one very minimal urge during lunch. Every time I smoked after day 4 it tasted bad, felt toxic and harmful, and had no reward to mask what the cigarettes were really doing to my body. 

There are also unexpected but desirable effects. It seems like Chantix has curbed my addictive personality entirely. I have a broad range of unhealthy habits that I've been wrestling with for years. I've found that every urge is weaker, and in most cases there is significantly less payoff when I act on them. I feel like I can finally exert control over several areas of my life without draining my willpower. I'm not any more motivated than I already was, I'm simply less drained from fighting with myself all the time. However, this can be a bad thing because I suspect Chantix indiscriminately interferes with established reward circuits. If I had a ton if good habits, or habits I didn't want to break, I'd be calling this anhedonia, which I believe is a commonly reported side effect. 

I researched the side effects and I'm reasonably concerned about them. I have a history of depression and I drink. I've had other mental health issues in the past where I mildly hallucinated and experienced intense paranoia and panic attacks coupled with manic episodes. It was a bad reaction to medication. If this works for me hopefully this will become a good account of the effects of this drug for people that may benefit from it. If not this will become yet another cautionary tale about the dangers of taking Chantix.

My impression at this point is the nicotine withdrawal will trigger the intense dreams, because the first oddly vivid ones happened on Day 6, after my nicotine intake had dropped significantly. I've read accounts where the dreams started several weeks in, and others where bad side effects started almost right away and they had to quit after a few days of taking the full dose.

I'm expecting the side effects I've been warned about to manifest at some point, but I've mostly kept it together through some pretty intense episodes in the past so it will take a lot to make me stop.

Background: 

Been smoking for 6-7 years, gradually smoking more and more. Started passing the pack a day mark recently. I'll go through a pack in a few hours on weekends when I'm drinking. Basically chain smoking whenever I have time, and often when I don't have time. I also vape while indoors.

I'm a big guy, athletic and muscular build with a little extra fluff. 6'3", 255 lbs, late 20's. The dose appears to be the same for everyone, so I wonder if my extremely mild side effects are related to my size and age.

selftext: I am 24 years old and have been a smoker for 4 years... 3/4 pack a day. I decided that I need to quit for a plethora of reasons (Why shouldn't one quit). Anyway, I quit on Saturday so I had been sober from cigarettes for 4 full days. Last night, I was in a really frustrating spot with my ex boyfriend and feeling really stressed and I caved an bought a pack. I have since then smoked 2 cigarettes - which I will say were both completely disgusting. Tasted gross, made me wonder what I am doing. I had a headache after both cigarettes. 

I am just wondering if anybody has any advice about how to move forward. I can accept that I have caved and smoked 2 cigs, that it's not the end of the world. But I would really like to prevent myself from sliding backwards and becoming a regular smoker again. 

Thanks in advance!!!

selftext: I quit cold turkey about 11 days ago, I still have my last half a pack of cigarettes I bought just sitting there on my dresser so I can tell myself I'm quitting because I want to. They don't have any affect on me so I keep them there, it's kind of a mental thing.

My way of quitting was a little different than most, not only did I quit smoking but I quit everything that triggered it as a habit, I limited my driving, coffee, even eating. It may sound extreme but it definitely helped and it drastically lessened the frequency of cravings for me. For the times that I did eat, I immediately replaced the after smoking ritual with just eating cinammon fireballs or gum.

The driving and eating triggers were taken care of so I figured I'd have my first cup of decaf coffee in 11 days today, and boy was that a bad idea. I got so flustered and couldn't stop pacing from room to room until I finally caved in and took one out of that pack. The good part though was that I couldn't even finish a quarter of the cigarette before I started getting dizzy and nauseous. It's been almost 16 years since my first cigarette, but smoking this one was exactly how that first one taste. This time though, instead of pushing myself through the disgusting taste and dizzying headache to finish it for the sake of my reputation among my teenage peers, I quickly put it out and threw it away. Part of me feels ashamed that I gave in, but another part of me feels OK that It showed me the true repulsive taste I have been masking by habit all these years.

I was never a morning person, or so I thought. The biggest pro of quitting has been waking up in the morning so easily it amazes me. Now instead of waking up to a big headache and heading outside to smoke the first cigarette of the day, I wake up and go have breakfast with my kids, instead of feeling ashamed to be around them wondering how bad I smell like tobacco to them. Even if I get a less than ideal amount of hours of sleep I still wake up 100x better than if I would've if I would've gotten a full nights rest as a a smoker. Stay strong... Those first 3-4 days are the only days you'll feel it, and even then don't worry about tomorrow, just worry about getting passed the next 15 minutes when you're having a craving.. I've been smoking so long everyone I know doubted I could quit, so If I could do it you definitely can.

However i felt as if I was able to objectively deal with the cravings better. Plus I was in a better mood and was able to laugh at the cravings! On day three I still had cravings, but they were more like an annoying mosquito bite to be ignored. 

I've been smoking for 12 years. I have seriously quit somewhere between 10-20 times. The longest I have refrained from tobacco is 3 months.

selftext: I am a stressed out medical student. I picked up smoking from an ex boyfriend of mine. From there when I would study, I would find myself smoking cigarettes here and again. Eventually, I started to crave them and crave them. I realized that both as a future doctor as well as a person, I couldn't continue this. I decided to make a change. I threw out all of the tobacco in my house and purchased the patch to control cravings. Today as of now I'm 36 hrs without a cigarette. I got the patch (level 2) and it's amazing how much it kills cravings. Yes it has nicotine, but the goal is to titrate down to level 3 and then eventually quit completely. 

I'm excited to see how this progresses.

selftext: About a year and a half ago I made my first real attempt at quitting. My habit wasn’t terrible, but it was there. I was 31 at the time. Had been smoking regularly since 15.  At worst my habit was 3-4 packs per week.  But I usually settled in the 2-3 range.  Anyway my physician just said try. So I did. I went with Wellbutrin. It worked for me. I stopped smoking for the better part of 4 months.  I was also sober at this time.  Then I started drinking again, then the Wellbutrin alcohol combo made me feel terrible so I stopped taking the pills, then I started smoking again.  Anyway a couple months of cigs. Then I put them down and went to a vape. No smoking cigs, just vape for probably the last year. Well long story short I went on a party trip last weekend and I thought I deserved to smoke real cigs. Hell. It was vacation. Drank myself into oblivion each day/night and smoked 4 packs in 3 days. After that trip I was so hungover and sick I decided I never wanted to do that shit again. 

I’m on day 6, no nicotine of any kind.  Been a rough go. Short fuse, very irritable but I know it will pass.  It will be worth it to finally, finally be nicotine free and not having to use a prescription.  I won’t smoke today.

selftext: Im 1.5 years into quitting (smoked 25 years) and not once have I regretted quitting. However, each cigarette you smoke will be regretted. 
I can honestly say that quitting has relieved me of so much burden: how i feel about myself, not worrying about how i smell, not timing activities so ill have a smoke break, not having to ask whoever im in a car with to make a pitstop for cigs, not having to hide from family and friends who will be judgey, not alternating from feining to feeling nautious, not having to get out of bed in the middle of the night to smoke...
What made me quit was suddenly no matter how much i smoked i still craved a cigarette. Sort of like my body was asking for the nicotine but couldnt absorb it. Because of that i figured i might as well quit if i wasnt getting relief from smoking anymore.

selftext: Hey All,


Longtime lurker, first time poster. I want to start by saying that the comments in this community have been helpful to me in the past. Thank you for that. 


So I've been a pack-a-day smoker for ten years. Over the past year, I've tried to quit and failed I don't know how many times. Vaping seems to work for me. I can get to the month point using 3mg nicotine cartridges. For whatever reason, though, my mindset just totally goes to shit once I get there. I've had anxiety and depression all my life, and I know that cigarettes make that worse, but after a month smoke free, I turn into a totally different person.


It stops being, "you're going to die and you're a terrible person" and it starts being, "everyone and everything else is the reason that you are so miserable." I turn into a huge fucking prick, basically, and the negativity just becomes all consuming. So I broke after three weeks this time; I started smoking again four days ago just to see if that's what it was and I'm finally feeling somewhat normal.


I desperately want to quit and be a healthy, happy person, but if it means I'm going to fuck my life up in other ways, I'm not sure that it's worth it. I don't want to lose my fiance, for example, because I've convinced myself (erroneously) that she's the cause of all my problems. 


Does anyone here have experience dealing with this kind of thing?

Thanks in advance for your replies.

selftext: I will start by saying I'm not a smoker and never have been. I've lurked your subreddit for a bit and it's given me a much better understanding and appreciation of what a challenge quitting smoking is. 

I have never been able to stand smoking - the smell, the teeth, the waste of money, the breath. My boyfriend only smokes when he drinks (maybe half pack in a 4-5 hour period of drinking) and he's wanting to quit because he wants to, but also because he knows how much I hate it. He's spoken to his doctor and there is a trial program he's participating in to help him with the process. 

Here is what I've picked up from searching on here, please let me know if there is anything else that someone you love has done that helped you, or if there are any other do's (just as important, don't) that I should be aware of.

* Buy a fidget spinner or something for him to do with his hands
* Buy some dum dum suckers and gum
* Don't get upset if he gives into his cravings once or twice throughout the process
* Frequently compliment him on not smelling, or noticing that he's doing well
* Hold off on going out for a bit (I've already suggested we don't go to bars for a few weeks)
* Ask him each night how he did that day
* If he starts getting a craving, try to distract him or leave the area
* Acknowledge he'll be grumpy for the first few weeks
* Ensure that he's wanting to quit because he wants to, and not just to make me happy

He has two bars he frequents a lot and all his friends hang out at. He also works at one of them - so it's difficult for me to completely remove him from the situation. I don't want to keep him from his friends, so it may be an obstacle we need to work around. Suggestions around approaching that conversation would also be appreciated!

Thanks!!

selftext: So I gave my cigarettes to my spouse. The last few quit attempts, I destroyed the pack but he \(non\-smoker\) got pissy with me because they could be given to homeless people. Please don't lecture me; I think that if you're dealing with that much stress, you are allowed some nicotine vices. 

Regardless, those cigarettes were NOT given to anyone. I found them. Is it unreasonable to ask the he dispose of them? Or at least give them away? I'm going crazy knowing where they are. If I end up going through his bag to get them I am going to feel like a crazy person and I'm worried the temptation is too great.

selftext: I was offered a job in a medical group that tests for nicotine. So this pack-a-day smoker went cold turkey. With tons of research, I'm drinking a ton of water, juicing, healthy crap, vitamin c, Apple cider vinegar....just your general detox that I'll probably also use when I quit kratom. 

It's a $20/hr part time job with benefits so I can still do graveyard CNA shifts to get my experience up. My ultimate goal is BSN. But clearly, I gotta get my shit together first. Wish me luck. And luck to all of you as well!

selftext: I get strong urges to smoke when socializing with smokers. I almost never smoke alone (maybe 1 cig a month), yet can't quit because I don't have the right mindset for dealing with the cravings I get in social situations.

selftext: What makes it hard is that I have no support around me. I was a closet nicotine addict, I started with dip and then used cigs in college. I decided to buy a Juul towards the end of of the semester so that when I went home I could conceal my habit better from my parents. 

I had about a pack a day habit, and I have called it quits 3 days ago. I feel in pain, I have been getting  angry at my mom for no reason and I get agitated easily. I feel as though I'm going about this alone and it is making it so hard for me. Nobody understands that I am having trouble sleeping, have a weird feeling in my head, and crave nicotine soooo much.

I know it's the devil, but life with the devil in it seems like it was better then this :(

These have been the worst days of my life

selftext: Hi all,
I’ve never posted before, so please forgive if this is awkwardly written.

I had quit smoking for a month and a half, then had a weak moment after a few beers and caved. That was a few weeks back, and I’ve been bumming smokes off my fiancé everyday since then (I bought two packs myself, but mostly just taking his). 
He has talked about quitting, but never acted on it. We live together, and he usually leaves the cigarettes on the porch when he’s home, so it’s not like I have to ask to have one. I think he secretly is ok with me smoking, because it takes the pressure off him to quit. He is a pretty heavy smoker, almost a pack a day, sometimes more. 

I know I can’t change his habit, only my own..but does anyone have advice for dealing with a partner who still smokes?

I’ve decided that today I will try again to quit, and do my best to stick with it, cigarettes nearby be damned!

selftext: Hey everyone, first time posting here. I've been a smoker for 4 years, cycling between a pack a day, to vaping 24/7, to nicotine gum, to nicotine inhalers, and to patches. I've also tried a variety of supplement combos. I've always tried to go at it alone, with no support. I'm 21 and living at home as a full time student. Both my mom and brother are heavy smokers, so I cannot ask for support from them. None of my friends are addicted (social smokers).

 I don't know where to go. If you guys can share with me what has worked for you, I'd really appreciate it. My mind is playing tricks on me and I need to know that I'm not alone...

selftext: Hello fellow stoppers, I have a question that you guys might be able to answer. I recently stopped smoking, went from smoking around 15 RYO per day to none, and I’m on my fifth day. Yesterday night I went partying with friends, they smoked, I resisted the occasional urges without any problems, so all is good. Shows that you can party hard even if you quit. But today after waking up and going about my day my lungs feel as if I’ve smoked a whole pack yesterday. Might be the hangover, I dunno. Might be the fact that we were in a room where people could smoke (so second-hand), might be the analgesic effect of nicotine wearing off and making me feel the years of bullshit accumulated in my lungs, I really don’t know. Have you guys experienced something like this after quitting?

selftext: Week one sucked.... but since day 10, I've had only the odd crave.... and they were entirely manageable. It totally has not been as dramatic, or as difficult as I feared. So why have I failed so often before? And why is THIS quit kicking nicotine's ass so easily? I'm genuinely confused. I suspect Allen Carr had a lot to do with it. 

Because I thought it would be so hard, I stalled. I thought
* No way. I can't do this
* I will be missing something
* I will eventually fail

Let me be clear. *I was 100% sure I would fail*! But it turns out I was wrong. The nicotine monster is like Freddy Kruger..... fear and nicotine make him stronger. You don't think about him, he goes away. You don't feed him, he dies. He can't fight you AT ALL if you don't smoke. It's an incredible weakness he has.... so you can kill him.
