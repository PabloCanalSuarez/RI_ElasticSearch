selftext: Hi, since someone i know has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, i had a few questions regarding the disorder.

First, are you still able to live relatively normal lives? Like mainaining healthy relationships with friends and family and going to parties every now and then? 

Second, has there been any progress in developing medication which also tackle the negative symptoms? And does current medication completely stop the positive symptoms?

I hope i am not being rude by asking this and posting this here, since i am very curious.

selftext: Hello everyone, I am not in a good place right now and I fear that my partner isn’t either, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few weeks ago now and the shock of the diagnosis plus her taking new medications has strained our relationship- she blocked me on everything earlier today and said she didn’t feel comfortable dating me in the last few days. But she always goes back to missing me and wanting to be around me. My question is what do I do here, how do I not snap, and how can I keep her safe and close to me?

selftext: Long story, but I got put in the hospital recently and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Before my initial diagnosis of psychosis a few years ago, I took adderall for my ADHD and it worked wonders in my life. Ever since that alleged 'psychotic episode' that landed me in the hospital, I have been taken off of my adderall and have basically been bouncing around from psych to psych seeking someone who would be willing to prescribe me the medication that works for me, adderall.. I do not even  believe I have schizophrenia so it is especially frustrating to think that this misdiagnosis is going to keep me from being properly medicated for the ADHD that I still struggle with and is debilitating. Thoughts or anyone here have experience with this situation? Thanks in advance.

selftext: I have not been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for years now but I’ve been having particular problems for around a year ever since I had a few bad trips with weed and took LSD and MDMA in the same night last July. I’ve always fairly superstitious but I feel like I just cannot trust anyone or anything anymore. Someone is always out to get me. As well as this, every time I leave my house I imagine my house burning down and my cats dying or my mum being attacked. I hear muffled noises every night and I freeze up and can’t sleep thinking about my house being broken into and my loved ones being hurt. I’m fed up and no one has been able to help me. Has anyone experienced anything similar to either of my issues? I’d love to chat.

I spent a year of my life as a recluse in my parents basement denying that I need meds and I can’t go back to that harrowing place. I9 years old now and recovering well. I was an very social guy before my breakdown and I’m pushing myself everyday to get back to that. So things are going much more smoothly than I had expected. Already got a girl I knew in high school trying to fuck. Problem is my sex drive is low and I’m afraid I’ll go soft. Will nofap help me?

Meds I’m on (must stay on):

Small antidepressant 
Small stimulant

selftext: Hello everyone. I am a student who was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 18. I am currently living in am adult group home with 29 other residents in Richmomd,VA and have been living there for 3 years. I feel like I am ready to live on my own. There are several reasons I want to move out including privacy, posessions being stolen, constant drama, and fighting between residents. I do not like the environment I am in and have not felt like I fit in here ever since I moved in. I need some help finding resources that will help me live on my own. I have a peer recovery specialist at the city behavioral health organization, but she is not answering my calls so I thought I could do this on my own.

TL;DR Need help transitioning into independent living.

selftext: Hey there I'm new to this sub which I recently found from a friend of mine. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia for about 2 years now and am currently adjusting back to life in the real world after a lengthy stint from inpatient for the 5th or 6th time in the last 3 years or so. I'm on a good mix of meds right now and I feel the best I have in years.

My friend suggested I join this sub as a way to talk to other people with my illness to try to feel like less of an outcast to society and to recognize that there are so many other people who deal with this horrible disease. I'll probably do weekly updates or whatever when I can just as a way to get stuff off my chest.

selftext: Back when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, people said *"but you have nothing to be depressed about"*.

When it was ADHD, people said *"but you do great in school"*.

When it was Aspergers, people said *"but you have good social skills"*.

And now that it's schizophrenia, I get *"but you're so normal"*.

I'm so sick of people butting in and telling me what my symptoms should be, or that my symptoms aren't schizophrenic enough for them. People who know next to nothing about me think that they can tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. Suggestions come out of their mouth like word vomit:

 - have you tried sleeping more?

 - you should run for 30 minutes a day

 - stop eating gluten

 - you shouldn't take medication

 - you need to get an EEG done 

 - you can't be hallucinating because you know they're hallucinations 

 - maybe you have autism 

I tell them that I didn't ask for their opinion and that I don't want it. I get it anyway. The classic "I'm not trying to diagnose you" as they try to diagnose you. 

Screw it. They're such experts I suppose I should just quit all medication, stop going to therapy, and just let them diagnose me. But they're not the ones who pay the price, so I guess they'll never care how much damage it does. 

My doctors say I'm schizophrenic and so I'll never be able to hold a job or live independently. Random people say that I'm holding a job and living independently so I mustn't have schizophrenia. 

So which one is it? Am I schizophrenic or a functioning human being? Do I listen to the doctors who tell me I'll be nothing, or the unqualified randos who tell me that my struggles don't exist?

selftext: I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2013. Since then I am in therapy and get medication twice a day. For even longer then that I am not willing to do something anymore to improve my life. I just smoke nowadays the whole day. I tryed to quit but the void is to big so that I rather would take the health consequences as giving it up. 

I get a lot of thoughts how to destroy my life, I not act to those thoughts. I talked already with my doctor about this that I will not change anymore. She just offered me work therapy but I could not do it, I have been there once and it was already too much for me.

I just see myself homeless if my parents die. I am not at disability yet, I am at social welfare. And in my country you need to participate in six to twelve months long projects. I do not want to do them, and I missed two dates at the Jobcenter. So my money will get decreased about 10 % from what I am getting. I got already a third date at the center. I know now already that I will miss that date too.

I am not willing to work anymore, I am sick of people. And to all of this comes my schizophrenia which is not a good add to my life at all. 

I am not asking questions here, just want to put a statement out there.

selftext: I haven't posted my story here yet and honestly I'd rather not, but I'm struggling with some really mixed feelings and hope someone would be able to help. I went through an extended period of abuse from my father, and since then I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which does have a genetic link. Thinking about his behaviour it would make sense, some of the things he did were similar to things I think of now. This realisation only came about 4 months ago, and its really hard having my view of him change from a monster to someone who maybe wasn't in control. I want to blame him so badly, he's out if the picture now so I want to just hate him so much but maybe if he was ill it wasn't his fault and maybe he did want to love me in some way and if I hate him because of his illness what does that mean for me.

 Sorry about rambling and I don't really have a question, I just was hoping someone else had experienced something similar and might be able to help me work this out.

selftext: Some backstory;
I have been in various abusive relationships from a young age, been to the police to try to mitigate harmful situations, been shot at in response to faliure to keep quiet about abuse, and been bullied since I started school when I was five years old.
During middle school things started to get better for a while, until I was assaulted by some of the employees of my school and subsequently bullied to the point where I spent every day with earplugs in so I couldn't hear anything my classmates said. After middle school I attended a summer program, where I first met someone who actually understood me, and I felt I understood. 
Two years later, she took her own life, recording her note and suicide on camera. I vividly remember the way her hand twitched as if beckoning me, as she tried to pull the trigger of her pistol another time. She shot herself twice in the head and died almost immediately. At the time of her death she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, her doctors also think she had DID but were unwilling to give a diagnosis because this condition is essentially a death sentence. She was on LSD, 25-I-NBOME, cannabis and cocaine at the time of her death.
She killed herself because she was also abused from a young age, bullied in and outside of school. After other suicide attempts her parents sent her to an asylum where she continued to experience assault and abuse. She took her own life when she was visiting home, knowing returning to the asylum would result in continued abuse.
I managed to graduate high school and start college before I was assaulted again, some of my classmates tried to take my life, and I ended up in a similar asylum. I was assaulted there as well, and tried to kill myself in the asylum the day after the assault while on hospital grade morphine. 
I left the state several days after, found a full time job living with my parents, and have been working ever since. I continue to experience abuse and bullying but less so than before, but I still experience suicidal thoughts. My doctors think I have DID but aren't willing to give a diagnosis because they also consider it a death sentence. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
At this point it is very surprising that I am still alive, and back in the asylum I told myself that I would wait six months and if I was still suffering I wouldn't proceed in this life. Most people with my conditions attempt suicide and many of us are successful.
If people close to me discover I am suicidal I will likely end up back in an asylum, or in prison for possession of an unregistered firearm (a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison in my state). Both of these options will only lead to more abuse and more suicidal thoughts. 
I feel like there is no way out of this situation if my personality dissociates to a suicidal one. What can I do to stay alive when the provisions for my suicide are a stone's throw from my house and I feel like my condition leaves me no escape?

selftext: It all started when I was 17, I started seeing these shadow people from the side of my vision. I assumed that it was nothing and talked to a doctor about it and he said that he was concerned that I could have schizophrenia. Ever since I see faces and people that I know  no one else sees. I get random feelings of pure fear and everywhere I look is some kind of monster or demon. I hear whispers and sometimes I get weird thoughts where I’m convinced I’m being poisoned or that the people around me are clones and are out to get me. I’m good at hiding it but I keep thinking to what my doctor said and if I have schizophrenia I could get worse and I’m scared. I’ve always had neurological issues since I was a kid and was diagnosed with ADHD at age 5. What can I do? I’m scared to go on antipsychotics because I know they can really mess you up but my last therapist recommended that. What are my options, how can I know what’s going on? No one wants to even go near diagnosing me and when I brought up schizophrenia with my last therapist she brushed it off and said that everyone jumps to worst thing and that it was probably lack of sleep. So where do I go from here?

I have recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia. We are working through a lot and trying many different medications. I'm just not sure if I want to take them. Some of the things I see and hear are nice. Some aren't. But the people I see, it's just part of me now.

I see 4 different people. And hear them if I don't see them. It's been a struggle but I manage. I'm just curious on some others coping methods and what they also hear and see? I've never heard from others with this and want to know what others have going on in their minds. It really seems to help for some reason knowing I'm not the only one seeing or hearing other things.

EDIT : Hit the 5 on my phone rather than 4 for the people I see almost constantly in some way or another.

I get raped and sexual abused by my (ex)boyfriend and closer friends. Also domestic violence is normal for me. My Mom and my little, psychically disabled brother who is younger then me, get beaten, often. I feel not enough. I feel like, I could change the Situation but I don’t. I hate myself for this. I fcking should change it. It is all my fault. Everything from abusing to beating. From being lied till get love and hurt after this. 

My friends do everything for me. For real. Everything. But I can’t take it seriously. I don’t realise it. I have such problems with perception that I have problems do drive with my car. I get Panikattacks. I start to cry, to scream. I am literally sobbing. I can’t take it. 

I am trying to that everybody hates me. Family and friends. So that our relationship“dies“, so I can. 

I will say it officially. I will kill myself if everybody hates me. And I will do anything. 

Once I lick blood. I get hungry for more. I am a thirsty bitch who lost the connection to the reality a long time ago.

selftext: I am a 23 year old white female, 5'4 and 100 lbs from the US. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia (paranoid - diagnosed 3 years ago), anorexia nervosa (binge purge type). and PTSD. My medications: 2.5mL haldol injection every 4 weeks, 1.5 mg cogentin, hydroxyzine, and mirtazapine. I am in therapy for all 3 of these issues. 

 I occasionally have this strange feeling that I am in a trance. It is hard to describe, but basically, I just can't interact with the world properly. It just feels... awkward. Then, I start having movements like grinding my teeth or grimacing. I also keep doing these repetitive motions, like trying to bite my fingernails or rubbing my phone or something and it feels like I can't control what I'm doing. Sometimes I get muscle rigidity but only when it's really bad. Another weird thing is it only comes when I get extremely anxious about something, like meeting new people or taking a test.

I've made a few changes and I haven't had an episode of this in quite a while, but it does happen. Taking my cogentin and hydroxyzine religiously have done a lot to help immensely. Klonopin and ativan also relieve the symptoms, but I do not want to take those medications regularly. If it's really bad and I can barely move, ice bags on my head and neck give me a little relief. 

I'm going to talk to my doctor about this asap, but I just want to know what to expect. Thank you all so much

selftext: I always was so proud of myself for being able to “put aside” my symptoms of schizophrenia to get through a shift at work, however as I get older it becomes harder and harder.

Today was the first time I realized and accepted that I really truly have no control over my schizophrenia and I am a victim of an invisible illness. I’m devastated because I’ve finally found a job that provides amazing pay, benefits, and a boss who actually gives a fuck about my well being... and to know my schizophrenia may take that all away from me just sucks. 

Anyone have any tips/ experiences like mine where you think you can handle your illness and then the psychosis amps up and you fall hard on your ass?  

I am not going to quit this job (as I usually do when I fuck up at work), I’m going to stick it out until they let me go, just having a hard time getting over the guilt of being inadequate, being unable to work a simple job, etc. I’m starting to slip into suicidal thoughts (not because I WANT to die, but because I can’t imagine what I have to look forward to if I’m condemned to a life of being a defective human). 

Have you been diagnosed as so low functioning that you can’t even hold a job? How do you find fulfillment in your life if it’s not through self generated income? What do I do now?

i'm definitely not dreaming and i know the people aren't physically there its almost as if they are just watching me but sometimes i have convocations with them i'm actually speaking "in real life" as my parents said they hear me talking at night. These people are usually friends, relatives or just people i know. I searched around for a little on the web and couldn't really find anything but i did find something that had a similar description to what i'm talking about and it said it could be early signs of schizophrenia. My family has a past of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. (i know this post is health related but it didn't seem fit to post on /AskDocs) i'm not sure to think and often my parents aren't very supportive with mental health issues. what should i do and does anyone know what i'm experiencing? thanks.

selftext: I know that I have depression. I've had it for most of my life. I've been diagnosed with it by two clinical psychologists. But my psychiatrist isn't helping me. He's helped my schizophrenia by getting me onto the right medication, but other than that he's not helping. I've been depressed so long and last year it was at it's worst. I just want to try medication now because nothing else has helped. Maybe meds will help? I don't know, but I want to give it a go. My psychiatrist refuses to diagnose me and won't put me on medication for it. Last year was the worst I've ever had it and he just dissmissed my experience by saying that I was, "just sad." I had just about every symptom and exhibiting lots of behaviours typical of depression and he just said that I was just sad. If I'm just sad then why am I still sad after 15 years? Anyway, I'm looking into other psychiatrists now because I'm at the point where I could just snap at any moment now and I'm afraid. I'm afraid of going into a deeper depression. I'm afraid I'll kill myself and I just can't do that. I have two kids and even though my mind tells me they don't need me I've been told by my family that they do need me. I need to listen to them and not to my depressed thoughts. Or so they say. I don't know why I'm even posting this.

selftext: First time posting here. I just really wanted to get the circumstances of my diagnosis off my chest. It's been really bugging me for a while and I want to know anybody else can relate to what happened.

It was my third inpatient hospitalization. I was only 16, meaning that my disorder was somewhat early onset, but my own doctor had been considering the possibility of schizophrenia (to dismiss an earlier diagnosis of psychotic depression) due to my unresponsiveness to treatment for depression along with a clear lack of many depressive symptoms and the intensity and content of my psychotic episodes. I had been admitted due to an apparent suicide attempt which I almost did not survive. At the time of admission, I was completely unaware of this attempt and could not explain the large wound I suffered. To this day I am sure I had hurt myself so seriously during a psychotic break, of which I have no recollection.

Upon admission, the doctors immediately dismissed any explanation my parents or myself had given regarding my psychotic symptoms. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and all accompanying psychotic symptoms written off as "attention seeking behavior" due to my age and the apparent "suicide attempt".

Here's where it starts bugging me. Having been given this diagnosis, I was taken off all antipsychotics and sleeping pills I had been taking to manage these symptoms, as they were deemed "ineffective" and "unnecessary", despite the fact that they had been shown to ease my symptoms drastically (albeit with some serious side effects). Even my parents had given them this information, which they ignored. I was placed on Prozac only.

This is where my memory fails me and I must repeat what I am told. On the third or fourth day of hospitalization, nurses on staff noticed I had not left my room for meals or group therapy sessions. According to patients and staff present at the time, I had stopped talking completely and acknowledge but could not seem to physically respond to simple commands. I started taking part in bizarre, ritualistic behaviors, and became extremely fearful of nurses and staff. I had gone in to take a shower, and at some point had ripped all the stitches out of my arm with force, losing a substantial amount of blood and creating an even more difficult wound to close. According to other patients, the nurses were yelling at me and causing me to become more fearful and withdrawn, telling me to "snap out of it" and that these attention seeking behaviors would not work. When I did not improve, they deliberately ignored me and advised other patients to avoid giving me attention or trying to help.

They had allowed this episode to go on for six hours until nurses noticed not only a bleeding arm but other self destructive behaviors like tearing my own hair out, which caused them to call a code. They injected me with Haldol and left me to sleep it off for several hours before taking me to the hospital to close the wound up. I remember waking up still clutching two very large clumps of hair.

It was only at this point that they began to listen to my parents' account of what I was suffering, and began to listen to my story as well. I was discharged a few days later with a new prescription for Geodon (which has been very effective) and two sedatives for insomnia. I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, and the staff apologized profusely because they were "frustrated" and did not understand what was wrong leading up to the psychotic break, despite my own warnings that I did show psychotic symptoms and I don't feel it's safe to go off antipsychotics.

Guys I am extremely upset by what had happened. I feel like I suffered a great injustice at their hands and that they deliberately ignored me when I desperately needed treatment. While I went on to be treated for schizophrenia with really great success (not cured, but functional!), I don't think this should have happened.

Has anybody else been mistreated at hospitals? What do you think of how they handled the situation?

selftext: 
I’m not diagnosed with schizophrenia but my OCD revolves around developing it. I do believe I am bipolar after I stopped taking Luvox (which I was just prescribed a couple weeks ago) for hypomania. Right now my heart is pounding, mind is racing, etc. And I’m just so scared I have this mental illnesses. Keep in mind I’m not having delusional thoughts, or hallucinations but my general well-being just feels so disconnected to reality. My OCD likes to play tricks on me of course (I have constant music in my head, intrusive thoughts, mental compulsions) but I also have visual snow where like my vision is grainy and I sometimes see speckles and dots of weird colors. I dont know what is wrong with me but this year has been the hardest year of my life. I dropped out of college, have no job, and just am in constant fear of going crazy and feel like I am… Especially now since I might be bipolar. I don’t know what to do because my erp therapist is very hard to get ahold of and I don’t see her often. My psychiatrist keeps putting me on drugs that don’t work or cause more harm than good and I’m just in such a mess… Can I get some insight, do you guys think I’m developing schizophrenia? I have such a hard time keeping track of my thoughts and constantly forget what I’m thinking now. Along with the music and voices as my intrusive thoughts.

selftext: i realized the last 8 months i spend in bed i have really declined rapidly. i can´´t form toughts anymore my mind has been blank for the last two weeks. i can´t read anymore and i can´t watch television anymore i just spend my whole day in bed.

i warned my family many times i am declining and i need therapist but they just told me i am just suffering from a burnout :/

i realize i am really screwed since i don´t know even the months of the year.

i never get help so this time i maked up a story that i hit my head and lost my mind and if i am lucky i can stay in a hospital in 2 months.

the most disturbing thing is my time perception i realized the last span of 8 months feel like a week.

i have no inner dialogue no conscious.

i don´t know what society is doing to me i am begging for help for a year and no one is helping me.

i live in a country with the best health care but they simply discard me always the only help i got last year was a high dose of antipsychotica which does nothing since i don´´´´t have positive symptoms.

2 weeks ago i finally started therapy with a therapist who really cares deeply but i simply can´t follow the conversations or form coherent sentences.

my family is constantly seeking conflicts with me asking why i always look angry \(i tried them to explain the flat effect caused by schizophrenia but they are ignorant even they did go to uni\).

the fact that i can´t form deep toughts is really the most scary experience i ever had in my misserable life.

if i try to think deeply i am unable and i experience huge distress.

i have a official diagnose of schizophrenia but now if i seek help they want to change the diagnose to autism but that is simply a lie because when i was a teen i was extremly socially and there is no evidence of it :/.

i am really cornered now i think it is the end for me i think a mind blank is the final stage.

selftext: So last week, I met with my psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I'm very relieved that I know for sure what it is! She said it's a fairly classic case. As I went to my GP for med help before my psychiatrist appointment, she bumped up my Olanzapine from 10mg to 15 mg.

Overall, the Olanzapine works great! I actually feel like a person again and I'm working with a personal trainer every week to combat weight gain. It's like a fog has been lifted from my brain and I can function again.

But I have one issue with the Olanzapine... It seems to wear off after 12 hours. I take it about 10pm and I feel great, but then when 10am rolls around, I feel very panicky, stressed, and down. Does anyone else have that issue? It's like I'm back to my old, anxious shell of a person when it wears off. I wonder if I should split my dosage so I don't have a time wear it wears off.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!

selftext: Hello, ive been in this reddit for a while, mostly a lurker. I have a question for yall.

Last october I was diagnosed with "possible schizophrenia" by my therapist. The possible is bc he thought i had schizophrenia based on the symptoms i told him i had in the past, bc at that moment i didnt have any. So he didnt know for sure, but he was almost certain.

The thing is that in january i went on vacation to Colombia. I had an attack there. I started hearing things and i had delusions for like three weeks, i even had visual hallucinations for one day (It was really scary). When i got home i recovered in like a week, but not fully. Now im seeing things almost every day, i also start hearing voices as soon as i get into bed. 

I dont have delusions (i think) and the hallucinations are different. The auditive ones are inside my head (another voice, but inside my head); the visual ones are more like a glimpse or a glitch. Neither of them are disruptive, so it's not a problem. The thing that has me worried is that i think my brain changed after the colombian episode.

What do you think? Has this happened to you?

selftext: I am trying to help my brother get diagnosed and seek treatment for what we believe is schizophrenia. He is 34 and has never had a job and was kicked out of school. We've committed him before but they didn't diagnose him and released him after the 72 hour hold. 

He has been talking to people who are not there. He does not trust anyone and believes people are after him. He thinks people are poisoning him and trying to control his brain. He told me he hears voices and they sound like they are coming from inside of him, but thinks this is a massive conspiracy against him to ruin his life. He thinks people are profiting from his demise, even his own family. His memory is deteriorating and he has isolated himself entirely. 

He has lost a ton of weight and does not look good. He doesn't sleep or bath and sits and obsesses over his delusions. I fear he will never get a chance to live a life away from his suffering or worse.

He refuses to get help and we cannot force him without his consent, unless it escalates into a situation where he may be a danger to himself or others which we want to prevent. 

How can I help him get the help he needs before something worse happens? Any advice would be very appreciated.

selftext: Do I have to take an IQ test to be diagnosed with ADHD, I'm 20 years old right now and all of the symptoms seem to  agree perfectly with my life story. If I was tested as a child would I have to have take one as opposed to being diagnosed as an adult? My reason being I just don't want to know and have it define my life. If you can in the comments tell me in what way and age you where diagnosed, I kinda want to see if testsl are more prominent in childhood diagnosis or adult diagnosis. Another question is how would I go about being diagnosed in college I know it's basically free there, and another reason I want to avoid an IQ test is because they're expensive and raise overall cost. I'm not a college kid looking for a drug study boost, just someone who's coming to grips with alot of challenges I had in my life. I get pretty average grades, but I had to switch a major because of course work load. Appreciate any feedback, thanks.

She just brushed off the former diagnosis, asking me whether I wanted to be diagnosed as borderline and that diagnoses don't really matter at all, and didn't let me explain thoroughly.

Just a minute after telling me diagnoses don't matter, she tells me my symptoms really might be adult adhd, but didn't let me explain that I don't experience attention deficits at all and that neither am I hyper(active) nor do I feel restless.

Well, at least she gave me fluoxetine for my extreme emotional instability and tavor for the really bad situations, which both are fine for me...but I don't feel taken seriously.

I'm probably fine with going there again to be tested, but I'm sure that test will say the same that I do.

I don't want you to diagnose me instead of her, as I said, I'm not dianosed with it and I'm going to see her again - I just really needed to vent a bit :)

selftext: Brian Wilson is such an inspiration for me. He's been struggling and suffering with schizophrenia / schizoaffective disorder (he's been diagnosed with both at different times) since he was in his 20s, and now he's 75 - he still struggles and is sometimes visibly ill, but he's also still writing and recording music, and is currently touring and performing. He is married and has 5 children at home, as well as 2 adult daughters. He seems reasonably content in spite of all the trouble and tragedy he's lived through, and that gives me hope that no matter how difficult things can be, my life can turn out well also. He seems like a really sweet, likable, genuine guy in interviews too. I think of him as an inspirational "schizophrenia success story" if you will. If you don't know his story, or if you do and haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend watching "Love &amp; Mercy". It's a great movie, beautifully done. Here's a trailer for it:

https://youtu.be/lioWzrpCtGQ

There's also a lot of great documentaries about and interviews with him on YouTube.

As a side note, Brian Wilson himself will be performing in my area in July, and I'm definitely going to force myself out if my house to see him, no matter how hard that will be for me. I feel like it's a once in a lifetime opportunity, since the man is 75 and could stop touring anytime. I think I would greatly regret it if I didn't go.

selftext: I’m wondering if you can advise me: My middle school daughter is possessive of friends - she has been referred to as clingy by her friend group at school. I have watched more than once over the years; she picks out a best friend and then becomes what looks to me to be obsessed. 

Her current best friend was just hospitalized a few days ago for what is now diagnosed as schizophrenia. My limited understanding of schizophrenia includes knowing that sufferers can get easily overwhelmed by people getting in their face.  I am aware that my daughter has done things like get upset when her friend does not text her back. 

However, the other side of the coin: I’m guessing my daughters intense style includes unconditionally accepting whatever her friends are going through. Provided the friend does not make her feel shut out. 

I have half a fear that my daughters demanding ways contributed to this break;  would you, in the position of my daughter’s friend, feel unconditionally loved and supported, or overwhelmed by such intense attention? And if you have an opinion, what could I even do about it?

selftext: A little background - I’m 25 and I’ve been diagnosed with OCD since 12. I’ve had many themes at the root of my OCD, including health fears, sexuality, relationships and general OCD “overt” behaviors like checking, repeating actions and avoidance. 

Now my main fear/obsession is schizophrenia, I fear that I’m going to develop it or that I’m in the early stages of it despite me having no symptoms. I’ve made the mistake of googling symptoms, taking tests etc etc and even though I don’t display any of them I’m still constantly checking to see if I’m experiencing them if that makes sense. For example, I’ll hear a bird chirping and I’ll just focus on it, then a thought would pop into my head along the lines of, “since you’re focusing on it, it must mean you’re  hypersensitive yo noises”  (a symptom of schizophrenia). I’m also checking my speech over and over to see if I’m making sense or checking my memory to make sure I’m not forgetting tiny details of certain things. It doesn’t help that I’m in the prime age where schizophrenia “would” develop. That just adds to the fear. 

Honestly if you replace the obsession of “schizophrenia” with any of my other past obsessions, the checking, rumination, anxiety and fear feel all the same. I don’t know why my OCD decided to latch onto schizophrenia after a couple of years of being mostly obsession free. It feels like I’m going insane over this, even though I’m lacking every indication of the illness. I don’t know if this has any correlation but I quit smoking (tobacco) about a week ago and that’s when this anxiety/obsession started gaining traction. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all and I wish you the best!

Although Nev Jones was ultimately diagnosed with schizophrenia rather than bipolar disorder I felt the article would be resonate with people on this sub as much that is discussed will surely be familiar. I particularly appreciated the observations the author made on stigma, the importance of social connection, and the power of a good therapist.  I also found the fact that Ms Jones was able to complete her PhD  and undertake productive work, despite her illness, to be uplifting. I am also incredibly grateful for people who work to ameliorate the suffering caused by mental illness. 

Despite being well written from my POV the article also had several blind spots (as people in the comments thread pointed out). I would have liked to have known more about her family and whether they were supportive,  as well as her material circumstances. There is also very little discussion on the role medication played in getting her stabilized.

selftext: Apologies ahead of time if this sounds jumbled and/or is posted in the wrong place. 🖤 

A little bit of background;; I’m 25, female, and I was diagnosed originally with schizophrenia when I was 11. My dad threw a huge fit saying how young I was, there was no way that was an accurate diagnosis,, so they re-diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. I was on meds until about 16 years old (Abilify and some other I can’t recall).
Fast forward a couple years I’ve developed a drug and alcohol problem. I never really became addicted to anything, just abused whatever I could. The most recent being meth, I finally stopped used everything when I was about 22. I stayed sober for about a year when I was diagnosed with endometriosis, where I began to use pills again. Not to abuse but for actual pain. 

Fast forward some more to recent months,, I’ve had a lot of awful episodes involving anxiety and depression. I had three panic attacks last week alone at work and I’m fearful of losing my job to due my mental instability. I noticed my anxiety come into full swing maybe a year or so ago, i figured it came with my endometriosis and being in pain 90% of the time. But my depression has come back with a vengeance this past month; I’m accustomed to the sad feelings and thoughts but am usually able to push them away after a bit. These just keep lingering. 
For the first time in nearly 10 years I self harmed... while at work... due to overwhelming anxiety. I’m a smoker, so I have a lighter on me always. The first few burns were enough to take the edge off,, barely even leaving a mark. By the third panic attack,, I ended up ‘over doing’ it in a sense,, this was a more serious burn. And looking at it now all I can think is “Why??” Why did i do that... sure it helped in the moment when I sat on the bathroom floor bawling my eyes out over literally nothing.... but a week later it’s just a painful reminder of how low I let myself get. 

Looking back at the past 4 1/2 years I’ve spent with my significant other I can recall all the mood swings and outbursts I’ve put him thru, the random crying and screaming in frustration and it makes me think.... am I getting worse?? For so long i thought I had been managing my BPD and here I am feeling strange in my own body wondering how much more I can take.
The suicidal thoughts are more frequent (not that I’d actually take my own life), I feel more drained with less even going on, my anxiety is thru the roof... at least once a day I experience disassociation, unfortunately most often when I’m driving. 

I don’t know what to do anymore,, obviously I want to see a therapist but in the mean time I don’t want things to digress to the point where I lose my job, lose the one constant (my boyfriend) in my life, and result back to using again.

So I was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed wellbutrin. The wellbutrin has helped with anxiety, hyperactivity and focus. However, I feel like a zombie on this stuff. I feel tired and don't have the increase in motivation that I think adderall might give me. Due to me feeling and becoming a zombie. My dad literally said I was a ghost or zombie when I took it. 

I was initially surprised that wellbutrin would help adhd symptoms because I never even heard of it nor it isnt officially an adhd medication. However, it is designed to work on the same exact neurotransmitters as adderall! Norepinephrine and Dopamine! Also, studies show that wellbutrin works just as well as adderall for adult adhd! I was excited when I heard this.

At the end of the day though I don't want to feel like a zombie and feel tired yet not feel the need to actually sleep. So I stopped it 4th day in. I believe from my results, adderall will be a better alternative giving me all wellbutrins benefits plus giving me the awake feeling that wellbutrin doesn't give me.

Martin Bryant (Port Arthur) was another one. I'm sure I'm forgetting a few. I don't mean to offend anyone. I don't think there is a link. I think an article I read with Lanza's father Peter, an incredibly strong man, summed it up best. He said "It irritates me when people try to blame Adam's acts on his Aspergers. Asperger's can make someone unusual but it can't make them into this.. You can't get more evil than this. I think the Asperger's diagnosis masked another contaminant.. possibly schizophrenia."

selftext: I never use reddit but I noticed just now that I had an account made a year ago. I found this place and I want to post and see what you all think.
A year ago when I was 17/18 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. I did get better over a few months as I got on my medication and seeing my psychiatrist. Eventually I felt really good at one point so I started skipping my meds and I started seeing my psychiatrist less and less (I do make phone calls with her every now and then). 
At first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. 
During my time as a schizophrenic I had strange dreams and visions of concentration camps and the gestapo. My delusions ranged from people plotting to eat me/kill me to me convincing myself that I caused the holocaust in some way.
To cope with this I started playing a game, doesnt matter too much so I wont talk about it, but basically for this game I created a mentally ill nazi vampire who I could project my delusions and hallucinations onto as a way to express myself and make myself feel better. 
For the time being this wasnt a bad idea, up until the last maybe 2 months when I started feeling psychotic again, increase in hallucinations and the delusions coming back, depression, anxiety, panic and anger.... 
This fictional character that I have created has not become a manifestation of my mind and it acts in a way I could only describe as an imaginary friend or a ghost thats haunting me. 
Without going into too much detail, my own creation I made to cope with my illness is now in my brain talking to be sometimes and giving me WW2 flashbacks that I never experienced.
Since this is not my frist time dealing with delusions I know they arent real, like I do snap out of it eventually but it is slowly taking a tole on my mind again. 
I do want to tell my parents and see my psychiatrist about it but im so scared right now and I wouldnt know how to explain this... I have nazis living in my head? I think I would be sent to an institution for something that weird.
I do want your advice.
Drawing was made during a semi-psychotic episode when I was home alone, few months ago.

selftext: I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder for a couple of years now but I’m not sure the diagnosis fits. I also suffer from severe depression that I guess is just lumped in with my anxiety. I never thought GAD was a very appropriate diagnosis because while I do have intense anxiety, depression came very close to killing me and seems like the more serious issue. I will ask my therapist the next time I see her, but I wanted a second opinion. 

I think I may suffer from bipolar 2 if not depression. I think this because I am usually depressed but I do not react well to typical antidepressants. My doctor recently prescribed me an anti-depressant for schizophrenia and bipolar depression (seroquel) and I’m doing a little better. Much better after getting off my other antidepressants, first effexor then abilify. 

I dont think I really experience mania although I do get very emotional, good and bad, and sometimes I feel the need to drastically change things such as moving, going back to school, changing my hair, quitting my job, etc sometimes multiple at once to try to make this stuck feeling go away. Is this enough to be considered mania for bipolar 2? I know mania is supposed to be not as severe in bipolar 2 patients. 

If I do in fact have bipolar 2 should that change anything about my treatment or things I look out for in my behavior? I live in the US if that is relevant.

selftext: Hey All

So I was referred by my GP \(Australia\) to see a psychiatrist regarding my concerns with my ADHD like symptoms, in hope of being diagnosed. I'd tried some of my friends ADHD medication two times a while ago, she also explained a lot of her life before and after being diagnosed, so I figured I should probably get tested as I'd lived with difficulties regarding ADHD like symptoms for most, if not all of my life.

I am not 100&amp;#37; sure If I want to be on medication or not, but I figured I'd get diagnosed so it's always there if I need to take it. I definitely don't feel like I need to be reliant on it to function, but it may get me through some rough patches, when I simply cant focus.

Heres the reason for this post \- When I saw the Psychiatrist, he seemed a bit annoyed that I'd been referred as a bulk billing case \(basically means I don't pay\), It quickly became apparent that he was not going to 'diagnose' me until hed been paid. He quickly put me through an ADHD test and I pretty much scored 9/10 so he gave me a script to Strattera \(I think\), but said I'd need to pay and be diagnosed to get onto Adderall, Dexys, etc...

I'm booked to see him again in a few weeks from now, But after reading all the paperwork he handed me, it pretty much feels like this is what will happen \-  I pay him, He will give me a script, and then I have to pay to see him every 12 months, to continue getting the script. This to me, doesn't feel like i'm actually being diagnosed. It feels like "pay me some money, its all i care about, and ill grant you 12 months legal access to these drugs". I always assumed that I'd get some sort of offical diagnosis, and that would be mine for life, not a subscription of somekind to the drug, more so than recognition of a metal disposition.

As stated, the paperwork explains how Id have to see him every 12 months, It makes me wonder if I'd be able to jump and see another doctor...The more I've read about the side effects, the less I actually want to take the drugs, and now I feel like my ADHD \(i'm pretty confident I have it, there isnt a box I couldn't check\) is being dismissed as all it really is about is getting on some pharmaceutical product.

Any advice or stories very much appreciated.

tl;dr: Was referred to a psychiatrist \- He made it obvious to me that he was only going to prescribe me ADHD drugs once I'd paid for a consultation as my initial one was bulk billed. I did some research and decided that I don't necessarily want to constantly be on the drugs, I now feel that a diagnosis is pointless with my impression being that I'm not paying to be diagnosed, but rather paying a yearly subscription fee to have access to the drugs, legally.

selftext: when i was 2, i was diagnosed with severe autism and at the time autism was a relatively new psychological phenomenon (1997). I had multiple counselors in and out of the house all the time. And finally, by the age of 7 i was diagnosed with Aspergers. And by the time i was 16 i became ineligible for disability due to a required psychological evaluation. I always thought (whether rightfully or ignorantly) i was unique because of it. I'm still not an NT. I still have "obsessions" and maybe even mild meltdowns. but i can hold down a decent job and am able to maintain eye contact and have a "successful" conversation with someone. Does anyone else on here have a similar story? I'm honestly very curious.

selftext: Hi, this is my first reddit post ever and i am on mobile, so im sorry if i mess up on any rules. Sorry for tjethe essay i just hope im coherent and clear. Im mostly asking for advice or support as i have no clue what to think or do with myself regarding treatment? I would like to know more people that have a similar situation too.

Im 23 and have been diagnosed with "just psychosis" to schizoaffective to schizophrenia. This started at 14 years old. I was on multiple medications for years and have tried many a mix of things. Risperdone, haloperidol, clozapine, CBD oil, vitamins, etc. Its been a rough ride but things are now narrowed down to schizophrenia and some other mood and PTSD disorders.

I am now 1 year and 1 month off of all meds. I completed a full DBT course before tapering off, and enjoyed the group sessions at the end too which is strange for me. This medication decision was encouraged by my psych of 3 years \(who was not the best\) and my therapist of 4 years \(who is really good\). I have multiple other diagnoses and health problems that led to this decision. The medications made me miserable physically and mentally and i have had pretty bad reactions to some. My therapist noticed i did better with skills and coping and grounding when i went a week or 2 without meds \(due to no money\). I am glad it happened, but now i worry more and more these last months that i should be back on meds.

Im not even on antidepressants now,i just do therapy once a week. Now though, i doubt myself constantly. I am not getting "worse" exactly, but i am experiencing more symptoms. My hallucinations and delusions do interfere with my life but it seems marginal to me. I am coping and living still. I just change my clothes or avoid 1 food for a day, or seem really dazed for a while. I have my little daily rituals of checking the house and my pets and i have a stable relationship so i cant complain. I actually handle leaving the house more often and i enjoy it at times too.

My therapist says she does not see any immediate need to be back on medicine, but my social life is absolute zero and im having more intrusive voices and beliefs and primal back\-of\-the\-brain feelings. I just constantly feel like i need to be doing something that makes me "better?" i have always been on medicine these last 8 or 9 years basically. I feel like i am stagnant and that other people see me as worse or bad and i cant tell what is just my brain saying it or what is true. Everyone around me says i am better and nicer, but i was taught that experiencing any of my symptoms was a "warning sign" that i am deteriorating. Im afraid that if i dont start medication again then i will be almost untreatable.

All in all, i would like to know if anyone else struggles with this kind of "impostor syndrome" experience after being unmedicated for large amounts of time. And if anyone else out there does better without medicine, how do you balance your life effectively? I do hope i can continue this path since its helped my physical health more, but i worry worry worry.

selftext: Hi there.

I've never posted to this sub before, mostly because I do not have schizophrenia and I don't know anyone with schizophrenia. But I have been researching the topic for six years and over time it has become almost like a personal issue for me. If this post doesn't fit on this sub, by all means, take it down, but I felt like I needed to come to this community for something.

Like I said, this illness has become almost a personal issue for me, and the lack of understanding most people have on mental illness, and the stigmas that surround this disorder, are frustrating and saddening. Recently I began a short webcomic, a prologue to a bigger story- the main character is a girl with schizophrenia and I decided to do a comic about her first experiencing symptoms as a child (she got very unlucky) and eventually being diagnosed. The full story takes place when she is older and a big part of my goal with the story is to portray someone with mental illness not only from an educated point of view (rather than a Hollywood one), but also give them a role as a strong protagonist. I believe people suffering from this illness deserve a lot of respect- you guys deal with things I can't even imagine having to deal with, and you deal with it every day.

The point is, as much research as I've done, I'm trying to make sure I write this illness as accurately as possible, and I was hoping maybe I could ask questions, because even though I feel very informed, I'm always worried I could have something wrong. If anyone would know about the experience of having schizophrenia, having visits with psychiatrists, and taking medication, it's those suffering from the illness. It would also be nice if you could direct me to reliable sources about this illness- there are so many misleading ones out there and I don't know what to trust besides the photocopies of schizophrenia's entry in the DSM, and from what I learned in my psychology class.

Once again, if this post doesn't fit, please go ahead and take it down. I figured this community would be the most authentic source of info, but I understand that this is a place for those dealing with this disorder to come talk to each other, and I don't want to interrupt that. This is your space more than it is anyone else's, especially mine. Thanks so much for reading.

And do we have an idea of how often doctors are diagnosed with depression, compared to the general population?  I could see it being slightly lower than the general population, since if it is bad enough, maybe you can't perform your functions as a doctor anymore (or you couldn't get all the way through medical school, etc.).

I am 50 and was diagnosed about 4 years ago. In reality, looking back on it, I was pretty sick for a long time. My illness was more gradual and insidious. I feel like I am slowly getting worse. I am on 2mg risperadol, and started taking some more recently because I just can’t deal with anything any more and it helps a bit. I am also on lamictal. My question is, for those who have been diagnosed for quite a while, have you steadily gotten worse? I was hoping I would be one of the lucky ones who would pull out of this in a few years, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The future is not looking good right now. I don’t want to be 60 and completely out of my mind or so drugged up I can’t function.

The psychiatrist said that my anxiety was probably the cause of my depression. Recently I was diagnosed with ADHD and I’m taking vyvanse. When I mentioned my mood swings to my ADHD psychiatrist, he said that it was a very common thing with people who suffer from ADHD. The vyvanse is great but it doesn’t help with the mood swings. I still experience my lows and lack of motivation but it causes my highs to be higher. 

TLDR ; so basically my question is, have you guys found anything that seems to eliminate or help with you mood swings?

selftext: A portable device common in optometrists’ offices may hold the key to faster diagnosis of schizophrenia, predicting relapse and symptom severity and assessing treatment effectiveness, a Rutgers University study finds.

In the [study,](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-21052-008) published in the May 2018 issue of the *Journal of Abnormal Psychology*, researchers used RETeval, a hand\-held device developed to record electrical activity from the retina, to replicate and extend prior studies showing that people with schizophrenia had abnormal electrical activity in the retina. This was the first time a portable device was used for these tests. The results show the device accurately indicated reduced electrical activity in the retina in multiple cell layers in the participants who had schizophrenia, including in cell types that had not been studied before in this disorder.

“Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder, probably the most disabling disorder long term. Although we know quite a bit about it, it’s still not that well understood,” said Steven Silverstein, professor of psychiatry at [Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School](https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/) and director of research at [Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care](http://ubhc.rutgers.edu/) \(UBHC\), who designed the study. “Our study should help generate further research into developing a test that clinicians – like psychologists, psychiatrists or nurses – can use in their offices to diagnose, treat and monitor the condition of people with schizophrenia.”

Looking at biomarkers in the eye as a way to understand psychiatric disorders is a new field of study.

“Since the retina is part of the nervous system, what is happening in the retina is likely reflective of what is occurring in the brain,” Silverstein said. “For example, we know that certain changes in the retina, like thinning tissue \[due to cell loss\] or weakening electrical activity, occur alongside loss of brain tissue and reduced brain activity in patients with neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. We and other researchers are now investigating whether retinal changes are related to brain structure and function changes in schizophrenia.”

In the just\-published study, the researchers evaluated 50 participants: 25 with schizophrenia and 25 with no diagnosed psychiatric disorder. In the test, the participants closed one eye and placed the other against the RETeval device, which flashed 10 to 20 white or colored lights of various intensity against a white or colored background. A tiny skin electrode was placed on the skin under the eye to record the retina’s electrical activity. The participants were tested in normal light and after sitting in the dark for 10 minutes to assess activity in different types of retinal cells. Most individual tests were completed within two minutes.

“Since many of our participants were experiencing severe psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, we wanted to use a test that was as noninvasive and quick as possible,” Silverstein said.

“While the portable device clearly distinguished people with schizophrenia from those without a psychiatric diagnosis, it’s too soon to call this a diagnostic tool,” said lead author Docia Demmin, a graduate assistant in UBHC’s [Division of Schizophrenia Research](http://ubhc.rutgers.edu/dsr/) and a doctoral student in [Rutgers Department of Psychology](https://psych.rutgers.edu/). “However, since every prior study has found that people with schizophrenia exhibit reduced retinal wave forms and slowed retinal responses, our research shows that we closing in on an accurate test that is faster, less invasive, inexpensive and more accessible to patients.”

selftext: Hello everyone! I read through the wiki and sidebar, and it seems like my question is appropriate for the sub, but apologize in advance if not.

My brother is 35, working at a good, salaried job, and lives independently in Rhode Island. He was diagnosed at age 20 with bipolar disorder, and takes medication for this as well as seeing a therapist. I live pretty far away and we see each other in person a few times a year.

However, in addition to the treatment of bipolar disorder, he has always expressed that he needs more support in areas not necessarily associated with bipolar disorder, like social skills and social cues. After spending some time with my wife's cousin, who has been diagnosed with Aspergers, I noticed some pretty striking similarities in certain things - lack of eye contact, difficulties understanding and interpreting body language or tone of voice, etc. I have come to suspect that he could have Aspergers or some other ASD, which could also explain a lot of the issues he says he needs more help with.

I wouldn't ask you all to diagnose him, but wanted some advice on how to approach the subject living long-distance. Do you all know of any organization in Rhode Island I could reach out to in this type of situation? Also, I want to be sensitive to him and not hurt him when bringing up the topic. Would you have advice on how to approach encouraging him to check whether he may have an ASD?

A close friend of mine and I constantly experience the exact same problems constantly. I dont usually think much of it, but recently I was diagnosed with bpd and we were talking about stress and anxiety and symptoms we both experience, and what she said she felt like matched the symptoms of bpd almost exactly. It struck me that she might have it too and that's why we experience lots of the same things. I can't make that diagnosis, but I want to bring it up to her so she can talk to her therapist about it. However she has incredibly out of control emotional reactions to nearly anything, (much like a bpd) and I don't want to upset her or send her on a spiral by pretty much accusing her of having a serious disorder. How should I handle this?

selftext: I was diagnosed with major depression disorder and schizophrenia about 6 years ago though I've been in and out of mental hospitals for 10 years. Trying different medications has been hell \(I'll save you the gory details\), but I've finally found a concoction that works for the most part.

The problem is that the meds have taken away so much of what made me me. I used to get enthusiastic about things like playing guitar, writing poetry, making fan\-videos, playing video games, riding my bike, target shooting, etc. I don't care about anything anymore. I force myself to ride my bike for exercise not enjoyment and I can't even find entertainment in video games \(I used to be a big gamer\). I haven't taken my guns out in a long time either. I just go through the motions. I live alone so at night I try to force myself to play some video games because they used to bring me joy, but I'll play a couple matches of Dragon Ball FighterZ or something then log off. I just can't stay interested.

On the other hand, the voices in my head are quieter and my mood is far more stable than it used to be. The meds are helping. I used to be extremely suicidal and it's been 4 years since my last attempt \(that's very good for me\). I'm stable enough to work now when before I couldn't handle basic tasks at times and found it difficult to hold a job.

So my dilemma is this: I was a wreck before these meds, but I've lost all enthusiasm in my life. I know I should keep taking these meds, but I'd be a lair if I said that I haven't toyed with the idea of getting off of them.

What do you guys think?

selftext: I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about a year ago. With the long tedious process of trying to find the right medications, we finally found one (clozaril) that seemed to muffle voices and greatly decrease hallucinations and delusions. That is until about two weeks ago. The last two weeks have been absolute hell, full blown delusions, Hallucinations and paranoia. This has triggered my depression and social anxiety as well. Everything came back even stronger than my first psychotic break. 

One of my best friends is having a birthday gathering tonight that I decided to cancel last minute on. I cancelled due to my extremely distracting hallucinations, lack of concentration and most of all believing that my friends (and others) are plotting to kill me. 

I feel really bad that I had to cancel and don’t think my friends and family understand exactly what’s going on with me, even though I am open about it. Anyone have suggestions what I can do from here to help people understand and raise awareness about this evil illness?

He refuse at first and his mother extremely oppose the idea of her son has mental disorder that needs help.
Somehow we convinced both him and his mother. We forced him to go on a session, he went two sessions. 
Diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Got the med (still adjusting the portion and type)  and he did look happier and much more like the guy we actually know.

And then his mother feels he is fixed for good, she actually convince her son stop seeing the shrink(without us knowing, not even his wife!)
And that’s what happen. 

I hated to say this but ignorance is not a bless, this is on her.
Don’t be like her. If you have problem. Get help.

Mental disorder is not like you can try harder to fight this.
You cannot think straight, you wouldn’t ask a paralyzed patient to try harder to walk.

selftext: Is it free to be diagnosed via the NHS? I know your GP has to refer you to a specialist, but would that cost anything?

I have another option. My university. They said that normally it costs £300, but I can get an assessment for £100. I might just be able to afford this... I just don't know if I should.

They said the assessment will take 3 hours, and there'll be a ton of paperwork involved. I mean, I'm certain I have ADHD, but what if I still fail to be diagnosed? After spending all that time and money, is it really worth it?

selftext: My 24 yo wife (who was diagnosed 4 months ago, has Aspergers) has these violent meltdowns that she says my ADHD is the trigger or to blame. She would resort to either hitting herself or breaking things such as our bedroom door or throwing cast iron skillets at me. She says she can’t control her outburst or her actions. 

How can I go about her learning how to control her actions just as I am trying to manage my ADHD?

Edit: we been married for 6 months, this is all new to me. Prior to her diagnoses she just suppressed them and wanted to fit in.

selftext: Now I’m not a big healthy eater like I love my maccas and stuff. But I was told that those who smoke and don’t have a good diet can half there life span. So, if you smoke and have a bad diet you might not make it to 40 yrs of age. If you include how much stress schizophrenia already puts on the body that can make things even harder. Now I’ll eat healthy sometimes but it never lasts long. But, I’m going to make an effort to not smoke after this weekend ... yes I want to quit. That’s gonna be especially difficult because I usually smoke 25-30 a day. But the last two days I’ve only smoked 10-15 so I’m getting there slowly! I wanted to make an effort this morning with my health so I made some cooked zucchini and half an avocado mixed it in a bowl and put some salt on it and that was my breakfast. I’m gonna try really hard to eat better... today after eating my healthy breakfast o didn’t once get hungry and was able to not eat for a long period of time. 

It’s really important to take care of your body. Especially when being diagnosed with a tough mental disorder like Schizophrenia. I’m not a doctor but I do know the amount of weight that antipsychotics put on, and how stressful the sight and sounds of schizophrenia is for every different person. It’s important to have a good diet because that way your body is being taken care of. And so will your mind. Smoking isn’t healthy and being more stressed and not doing the good that your all body needs can only lead to more bad things. 

Last time I tried to quit smoking I ended up self harming. I wish I kept going those few days without smokes even if it meant scarring my arms and legs. It’s better then smoking and making your health get worse rather then better. Plus schizophrenia already lowers your immune system and can only mean that living won’t be for as long if you don’t make an effort to make it better and last for ages. 

I’m not saying you have to perfect. But it’s good a good place to start is to eat better and lower the amount you smoke if you smoke at all. 

Thank you and sorry for such a long post!

selftext: I was just diagnosed with BPD. \(Wednesday 5/2\)

I always suspected I had some sort of personality thing, but got frustrated that my therapist wasn't actually helping. It turns out, he's been trying to help all along, but he just didn't know if I was ready to be approached. The semester just ended for me and I came at him like a storm about my suspicions and how I didn't know if he took me seriously, and then he told me everything. Since I have been coping with my mother being diagnosed with BPD recently, I have apparently been ignoring all the horrible signs. \(although I think I totally saw them but decided to ignore them\)

I guess I just wanted to say hello! I will be using this subreddit as well as my therapist to cope with my diagnoses, but as of today I don't know if I have fully let it sink in. Any advice would be much appreciated \&lt;3

selftext: I have suffered depression for nearly 4 years now. I went through highs and lows throughout that time. I was diagnosed by a doctor one year ago. But I have not since been on medication. I was specifically diagnosed with chronic depression. From what I understand, I can have good days and I can have bad days. 

When I was diagnosed I was in the bad days. I tried to kill myself and that's what led to the evaluation and diagnosis. They made me take antidepressants while confinement and gave me 2 weeks worth for when I was discharged. My mom dissuaded me from buying medications the moment I was out of the hospital. In retrospect I was on medications when she made me agree and I thought I was done with depression. And luckily enough I was in my good days for a while. 

Now I am in the bad days again. And my mom says that I got through it for nearly a year so she still wouldn't agree to buying medication. I am only a student and I am still dependent on her. I couldn't attend classes because of it. Classes would give me major anxiety. Walking to class feels like I'm being pushed off a cliff. I feel like I'm at a dead end. I can't function properly because I need meds. But I can't get meds if I don't get a job.

selftext: Hey guys, great to see a big community that involves so much positivity and allows people to share their thoughts, I'm just going to post here, a snippet of my life and the wars I have with schizophrenia.
I've been diagnosed more then 10 years ago even though I'm on my late 20s, the professional psychiatrist at the time, went from thinking I had done drugs (only smoked weed occasionally with friends in high school) to a psicoses diagnostic. It's changing in my country, but at the time this kind of mental illness was perceived as the guy is just "crazy", a very taboo topic! You guys can probably relate to this, the feeling of hopeless the voices giving you orders.
Acting like a complete mad man, I spend a week in the psyc ward taking all kinds of medication. After that and becouse the crisis were still going my mother decided to take me from the hospital psychiatrist to private services in a clinic. My doctor had a opinion that I shouldn't know my diagnosis, I was to shy to ask so I went ahead. Started taking 6 pills a day and put on a good amount of weight. After the major crisis I had I lost almost everything, but I don't care I still have a family that loves me and my dog. Now currently I'm working, medicated and doing therapy, best decision ever! The pills won't save you, you need a professional to work with you at least 2 times a month to build your brain.
I guess I've extended myself, but to finish! Please don't let the voices dictate you, hurting yourself is not the answer, it may sound hypocritical becouse when I'm with symptoms I do think that maybe death would be better. But now that I'm working on myself and trying to healthy I have a lot more days come.

If you read it all thank you, any input would be nice guys, cheers!

I was diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago. I also have been diagnosed with clinical depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. My mom is a classic Borderline, although she still operates under the misdiagnosis of Bipolar to this day. We haven't had contact in a few years.

I guess I'm here right now because I am feeling very frustrated, hopeless even, re: the lashing out. I feel like there's a terrifying, rage-filled monster living in my head, and she comes out about once per month. My S/O and I are just so tired. I've been diligently searching for a DBT therapist who takes my insurance and I'm not getting anywhere. I want to be my true, gentle, loving self, and I want to get help, but not being able to find it is really demotivating right now. 

Anyway, thanks for having me. Hopefully I'll become an active member :)

selftext: My mom had schizophreniaI am constantly worried that I am going to develop it. I have some odd symptoms, and my biggest concern is sleeping and a few others. 

I am also diagnosed with PTSD and have been experiencing derealization disorder for a year straight. I have some symptoms that im not sure if theyre particular to anything I suffer from, or if theyre the onset of my moms schizophrenia. 

I can go to bed at 12 AM and wake up at 10 AM and I won't feel refreshed at all. It's worry me cause of course theres more information on fatigue with schizophrenia then there is with anxiety/depression and fatigue. Of course if you ask a therapist, they say Oh yeah it can be caused by anxiety. I just wanted to know if any of you experience fatigue like this, it will reassure me greatly. 

I guess the other big symptom I have is paranoia, but whenever I take a paranoid personality quiz it says I don't have one. I'm not paranoid over everyone though. 


I have only been told two times that I was acting irritational. One time I was in the middle of the woods with my friend and there was a man sitting on a tree stump. He saw us and stood up. I said to my friends "lets go the other way" and I started speed walking. They told me to chill. The fact they were freaking out makes me feel like I have something wrong with me, but on the other hand there was literally a man sitting in the middle of the woods and he got up when he saw us.

The other time I walked to a food store with my friend at 3 AM. The food store was closed, but there were like one or two cars in the parking lot. A sketchy looking lady got out of her car and started walking towards us. I started walking the opposite direction fast. My friend told me to calm down. This again made me feel like something was wrong with me.


I think it's worth noting Im flinchy and have an extreme startle response, but I wasnt abused. I was around my alcoholic father who would go on rampages and I didnt feel like the enviroment was safe. Im wondering if the two things I listed could be contributed to PTSD, or are actually normal signs of paranoia. In both situations I thought it was justified to be sketched out, especially the worst one. I know no one here can diagnose me, but I was just asking for your guys input and if you had any similar experiences

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADD about a year ago at the age of 21. I always knew I had trouble focusing but I thought I was just lazy or had a bad work ethic because that's what my dad implied when I complained to him that I couldn't focus. I was a good student throughout high school, but I always knew deep down that I could do better. Now I'm in college and even though I've been diagnosed, I still struggle to accept that this is a real issue. I keep telling myself that I'm just lazy or that I'm not as smart as my peers. I'm really struggling to finish out the semester, and I keep kicking myself for it. I should have tried harder, I should have studied more. I'm taking 19 credits and it's really, really hard. Last semester was my first time on the dean's list since my freshman year. I was really proud of myself, but this semester, I'm struggling to get passing grades. I know what I have to do to catch up, it's just the actual /doing/ of it that I'm struggling with. I know I can, but I'm having such a hard time, and I feel like I can't talk to any of my friends about it because I'm afraid they won't believe me. It's just so weird being diagnosed with this as an adult. My psych told me that it's common for ADD to go undiagnosed in women, but I guess I just feel like I'm a fraud. I know I'm not, but I feel like I am. My dad has this belief that Americans are overmedicated, which may be true in some cases, but I never told him about my diagnosis \(or that I'm on Concerta\) because I know he'll just laugh at it. I'm just rambling now. I dunnno. I guess I just want to know if anyone else feels or has felt this way.

selftext: About 3 weeks ago I was diagnosed with combined ADHD. I just finished my sophomore year of college yesterday after failing 2 finals. I started 10 mg adderall twice a day last week, but it was still extremely hard to study for my finals. I just feel so worth less. I cried myself to sleep yesterday after seeing a literal F as my final grade. This is going to be the 3rd time I take this class since I dropped it last spring due to my inablitly to put in enough effort. Ever since my diagnoses I’ve constanly been on this subreddit, and it’s truly made things easier. It was like a weight was lifted off my chest when I discovered that I wasn’t a lazy terrible piece of shit, but after literally trying to study 5 days straight to only receive an F on my finals I feel so hopeless. After submitting our grades, my professor emailed us saying how it was a pleasure teaching our class. But then left a ps saying “Well it was a pleasure teaching the ones who were actually coming”. I know this wasn’t directly @me but it was hard reading that. Before my diagnoses, and before I ever considered having ADHD I knew l had a problem with attending class. l would try anything and everything to make myself actually make lt to class, but l barely did. His email only made me feel like a bigger fuck up. I’m just so lost and alone right now. The day I was diagnosed I called to tell my mother, and she replied with that’s not true you don’t have that. I’m not really sure what the point of this post is I’m sorry. I’m wondering if it will ever actually get better. College has truly been the hardest thing for me, and now l know it’s because of my ADHD, but l just don’t know how I’m going to make it another 2 years. And not even make it, I’m terrified I’ll never be able to raise my gpa. l don’t even want to look at my gpa now after my finals, I thought 2.5 was bad. Again not sure what the point of this was i guess just express my feelings.

selftext: Tldr: Should weight/bmi still be part of diagnosing  anorexia?

So I have never had anorexia and I've only known a couple of people who have had it and haven't really spoke to them about it a lot.

From what I know about it, its starvation as a method of control and is a mental state causing body dysmorphia as well as having physical attributes. (Correct me if I'm wrong in the comments).

I always found it weird that a person can't be diagnosed as anorexic until they are under a certain weight or bmi.

DSM-5 says for a person to be anorexic, they must show: Persistent restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight (in context of what is minimally expected for age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health)

And as far as I know most drs use BMI to measure this?

Like, if the person is already showing all the other signs of anorexia and is in the mental spiral of obsessing over their food / looks / weight to the point of not being able to live normally, why would it make sense to not diagnose them until they are under a certain weight?

Isn't better to help people before things get too extreme? I feel like with all other mental illnesses they say to get help before it gets out of control but it seems to be different with eating disorders? 

Idk, I'm not a dr or anything, it just doesnt seem to make sense to me.


What do you think?

Every six months to a year, I would be renewed provided I didn't step out of line.  I feel as though I haven't stepped out of line too much, in the sense that all I've been trying to do was build a future for myself that I could live a life of relative comfort.  Started going back to school, the works.  I quit my job because of the anxiety that I experienced while at work. Unable to leave of my own accord and if they wanted me out, I wouldn't be anywhere else.  It has all come to a head in the past couple of days.  I feel as though I have to die to preserve the lives of others. I don't know what to do.  I don't know if I'm experiencing delusions, or what's happening.  I was diagnosed with anxiety, but nothing more.  I guess I wanted to share my story to see if it fits schizophrenia.

selftext: So, I was diagnosed in 2013. It was quite an experience. I was so happy because it answered all the questions I’d ever had about myself. 

But, shortly afterwards, for about 6 months, I regretted it so much. I wished I’d never been diagnosed or even asked about going on the waiting list to be diagnosed. 

I thought acceptance meant I could shout it from the rooftops, before realising that doesn’t have to be the definition of proud if I don’t want it to be. 

I rarely tell people and if I do, I have to trust them. Sadly, I told 2 people I wish I hadn’t and I can’t take that back. 

For the most part, I’m chill with my diagnosis because the positive aspects of my Asperger’s far outweigh the fact that I can’t follow simple directions off someone or hug someone without asking if it’s ok first. 

But sometimes, I wish that I could press a button and experience just one day without Asperger’s and see how different it would be. 
Sometimes I wish I could make it go away. I’ve even considered going to some of those awful classes that teach social skills, it got that bad. 

Most of the time, I’m quietly proud of my Asperger’s, but I don’t feel like part of a community because no-one I’ve met on the spectrum has ever fit any criteria for a friend. In fact, if I do meet someone in the spectrum, I know we won’t be friends because we’re so different and require very specific things for friends. 

I don’t know, I’m going through another one of these phases where I kind of hate my diagnosis. I do once in a while. 

This wasn’t meant to offend anyone or anything, as I know that talking about cures can really piss some people off. I just needed to get it off my chest...

I so I've never go to a doctor or therapist, because nothing I've had ever got serious enough from my perspective, so from now on know I haven't been diagnosed with anything by a professional.
About 2 years ago I think I started to get depression. Thats what it seemed like to me and the few friends I talked to about it (who were all actually diagnosed).
Then I started having what all my friends told me sounded like anxiety attacks (again they all had both anxiety and panic attacks).
So what happens from my perspective is that first I get the jitters and start shaking or have to move around. Its like i have way to much energy and it cant get out. Then my chest gets super tight. I have asthma and its nothing like that, nor is it like there is a weight on my chest. Its more of like a contraction. Then the air gets thin like I rose in altitude. Then either the walls start closing in and I get claustrophobic, or I get like tunnel vision but only in my head, or both. And i get hot but only in my head my body is normal I just feel hot. And it takes me a while for this to stop.
During one of these episodes, once and only once I started having hallucinations(i think) like I was seeing monsters or scary people/things that weren't there. Then when I would close my eyes to try to sleep or not see thing, even more scary images would pop into my head, accompanied by shear terror (example: scary clowns, i have no fear of clowns, scary or nonscary, but some clowns made appearances, and i was filled with more terror then I've ever felt before. I thought that this was the beginning of schizophrenia (first year of college, I know most adults who have it get it in college I think) but nothing like that ever happened again and that was 5ish months ago.

In the past 4-5 months this is all gotten better. I'm no longer depressed (again never diagnosed but I'm good now) and I don't have these attacks anymore. I know in the rules we're not suppose to look for or give medical advise, but that's not what I'm asking. I want to ask
1. Does that sound like a panic attack or not?
2. I don't seem to have these in response to anything and I always hear about anxiety being about a particular thing or a trigger. But is there like a general anxiety or like sudden onset anxiety? I don't know thinks please halp.

Tldr; was I having anxiety attacks or nah???

selftext: I'm 24 years old now. Always had suicidal thoughts all my life. Due to being bullied in school. Due to not having friends in highschool. Failure after failure in college. I never gave up. And then I was diagnosed with  herniated disc which caused me pain for the last two years. Sciatica in my right leg all the time and also in my left leg at times. And I'm going bald which is giving me a lot of confidence problems. And now like the cherry on top , I've been diagnosed with cervical disc problem. Just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 23, how the hell am I supposed to live the rest of my natural life in pain everyday. And the average life span in my family is almost 90 years. My family doesn't seem to understand how bad my pain is. My dad understood it when he saw me limping due to pain in my legs. But my mom and the rest of the family always trivializes it. They call me lazy when I try to take rest in bed . She won't understand no matter how many times I explain it.

selftext: I was diagnosed with uveitis when I was a child and i think the medication I took's side effect was cataracts. (I really don't know the specifics because I was too young to remember, all I could remember is that by 3 years old I already had glasses on.)

I had cataract surgery when I was 12yo, where my left eye's lens was replaced with an artificial one. (The surgery was only on my left eye because the cataracts were worse on it.) My left eye then had good vision but after a few months it started to blur so we went back to my ophthalmologist and he did laser treatment  on it. The vision was good again but the blurry vision still got back after a few months. I was diagnosed with band keratopathy. So I had laser treatment again. It was a cycle and I went back and forth for a 3rd time until we can't afford the expenses and surgery anymore. 

I am F, now 21yo, 167cm, 50kg, no smoking, Filipino. I have since graduated high school and college all while using one, barely but fairly functioning, eye. And I will try to save up money when I'm employed so I can afford to save both of my eyes. 
If there is still anyway to treat it what could the options be?

Hi I’m a 38yr old male undiagnosed/suspected ADHD. After waiting 8 weeks for a GP appointment to ask for an ADHD assessment I have been referred to my local community mental health centre. 

My referral is in 5 weeks and is with a consultant psychiatrist. My letter makes no mention of ADHD, says to allow an hour for the consultation. 

I’m live in the south East, UK (Sussex)
Has anyone experience of being diagnosed by an NHS psychiatrist and not a specialist ADHD service? I’m not sure if I’m just being assessed for a further lengthy referral. 

I’m  in quite a bad place mentally.  I’ve recognised that I’m in a cycle of stress and anxiety caused by my inability to focus at work. I can now strongly correlate my ADHD traits to my current situation and similar past experiences. 
In addition to the daily ADHD stuff (misplacing phone etc.) I seem to experience periods of extreme anxiety when work pressure is high and I’m struggling to deliver to programs and forcing myself into hyper focus to get anything done which is exhausting.

selftext: So, I figured I should mention, i have been diagnosed with ADHD. 
And while I've not been diagnosed further, i do suffer from depression and anxiety. Anxiety is mild as I dont often have anxiety attacks. And depression comes and goes in periods of really bad and just a mild, mediocre feeling. 
Naturally, there are good days and bad days for all of this shit. 

Anyway, the reason I post, is I cant get anywhere on time. You could tell me a date and time a year in advance, and remind me every day, and I'll still show up 10 minutes late. 
I started a job last August, almost 10 months ago, and I have shown up on time once. Lucky i have a very chill boss. But, I'm always 10 to 45 minutes late. 
I've lived in 2 different homes since getting this job, and no matter what I do, I end up late. 

It's like me being late is just a part of my very being. I cant help it. 

Does this have a name or does anyone else deal with this bullshit?
It causes shit tons of stress and I'm so fucking I
Sick of waking up, thinking I'll get fired the whole drive to work. I cant even get a steady/career job because of it

selftext: Me: Female / 22 / 115lbs / Korean

The question is actually about my dad: Male / 57 / 160lbs / Korean

So my dad has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but I am skeptical since it doesn't seem to fit the  diagnostic criteria and I've heard that non-schizophrenics can have psychotic episodes as well. He really wants to come off antipsychotics and I was wondering what your thoughts are.

My dad had his first psychotic episode after being fired from his job at 36. He had delusions (thinking that everyone in Manhattan was out to get him) and auditory+visual hallucinations. My mom made him go see the doctor and he was put on Risperidone which completely diminished these symptoms. He tapered off after a year (with an ok from the doctor).

His second psychosis happened last year (at age 56). He was going through midlife crisis and we noticed him gradually withdrawing himself socially. After some point, he began spending all his day in his room, not showering, barely sleeping, barely eating, and not talking to anyone. I would sometimes run into him when he came out to use the bathroom, but he just seemed very off and distant/emotionally absent. This went on for 2~3 months until one day, he broke out in full psychosis. He began questioning my mom because he thought she had poisoned his food. He also later told us that he was having auditory hallucinations (voices from grandpa who passed away long ago). He ran away from our house barefooted because he thought we were trying to kill him. We called 911 and he was taken to an inpatient facility by the police where he stayed there for the mandatory 72 hours. During his stay, he was put on Olanzapine which again got rid of all the positive and negative symptoms. He has been on it for a year now.

I'm certainly not a medical professional, but I am skeptical about his diagnosis because:

1. His age of onset was 36, and I've read that symptoms typically first appear around early to mid 20s in men. Furthermore, he was a perfectly normal, loving dad (with typical dad jokes) during my childhood despite being off medication the entire time. I actually didn't know he was schizophrenic until the second psychosis because neither of my parents told me.

2. I've read that most schizophrenic people have hard time adapting to society, but my dad is quite successful in his field (B.S. from Harvard, M.S. and Ph.D from Columbia, had multiple engineering journals accepted for publication, etc.). He also worked as an electrical engineer for quite a long time before he decided to retire early. 

3. It's only happened twice in his life, 20 years apart, and both under extreme stress which I believe was the cause.

4. No family history of schizophrenia.

Honestly I don't really care either way, but the problem is that my dad is very miserable on medication. He doesn't suffer from typical side effects like weight gain, but he says that his memory and the ability to focus are completely destroyed when he's on antipsychotics (both risperidone and olanzapine). Because he has retired, he spends most of his time reading engineering papers/journals and learning new things. However, he says he can't no longer think and feels like his brain has frozen. He seemed defeated and cried the other day which broke my heart since I've never seen him cry before. He wants to come off medication and I just want him to be happy. I've told him it wouldn't hurt to ask, but my dad is a very shy/non-confrontational person, and is afraid to bring it up with the psychiatrist. I am wondering what your thoughts are and how he could approach the psychiatrist about this issue.

selftext: How can you tell? I was diagnosed with depression years ago, but sometimes I feel like it's more than depression. My mood changes a lot within a regular week. Two days a week I'll feel very sad and hopeless. Two days a week I'll feel very motivated and overly hopeful. Some days I joyfully laugh a lot and sing. Other days I laugh like a madman at my misery and feel like doing nothing all day.



I don't know.  I never seem to have a consistent state of emotion. The variance of mood is higher for me than what I see in others. 



How would I know if I'm bipolar? Sure, by getting diagnosed. But the professionals I see can easily continue to say I'm depressed, because I've heard that bipolar is notoriously difficult to diagnose.

selftext: Hello!!
I'm not to sure what I want to get out of this but I think I just want a tad bit of support and maybe see if anyone else can relate to anything like this and what their take on my situation is.

So about three months ago I had a panic attack, afterwards I experienced heavy dp/dr and because of this I genuinely thought I was going insane. After searching up symptoms and researching for days I've developed this fear of losing my mind, specifically developing some sort of mental illness like Schizophrenia. Generally the fears are either hallucinating or thinking in a delusional manner and when they are at full force it is pretty difficult to put them to rest.

To add to the stressors my father was diagnosed with Bipolar not to long ago, and I had smoked weed (three times to be exact) and my mind cannot put these factors to rest when the fear comes up into my mind. I've always had the fear of being like my father to a certain extent, however it did not affect me anything the way it is  right now. I keep thinking that I've messed with the chemicals in my brain by doing marijuana and triggered the onset of a severe mental illness.

I've been to a psychologist who reassured me that I wasn't going Schizophrenic, however amidst all the DP/DR she didn't diagnose me with an anxiety disorder and questioned whether I should even bother coming for another appointment, as she was convinced the reason for the anxiety and worry was due to stress within my life, namely being financial issues/ moving away from home/ breakup etc. The reason behind this was due to the fact that without any treatment I do feel myself slowly getting better and overcoming the anxiety however it has been a fairly bumpy road.

So sorry for the long post and this is my first post on here so if I have done something wrong I am so sorry!! Thankyou in advance for reading and hope it wasn't too boring :)

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD about 5 years ago, for as long as I can remember I've always felt hyperactive and frequently bored. I remember when I was 14 I hated long classes in school because sitting down working for 2 hours was horribly boring so I would sometimes say I needed to go to the bathroom just so I could walk around for 5 minutes. 

Since then I've developed Anxiety, Depression and OCD problems and been diagnosed with Aspergers as well. When I was 16 I started experimenting with drugs and have been using drugs occasionally from then until the start of this year. I've taken a 4 month break from all drugs  and am currently unemployed at the moment but I start work in 2 weeks. I've noticed for the last couple of years that I feel bored most of the time and life honestly feels like torture to me because I feel like there's not a lot of things that satisfy my boredom.

Stimulants like caffeine and amphetamines can help the boredom but they also make my anxiety worse sometimes. I find it hard to find things that im actually interested in doing. Life just feels so boring to me and I'm not sure if this is mainly from the ADHD or Depression and Anxiety?

I'm seeing a therapist btw but I was too afriad to tell her in fear that I was going to be diagnosed with schizo or psychosis.

I dont get how something like this can just happen out of the blue, i'd say this started a month ago and the first two times I didn't think anything of it, I thought maybe it was just some night mare or my brain didn't have enough time to wake up so I was still dreaming. Now the past week it's been almost every night. But I've noticed when I take naps in the day time it doesn't happen. Only at night for some reason.

selftext: I recently discovered that what I've always been diagnosed with, which is Social Anxiety is actually Avoidant Personality Disorder, but that's not what this post is about. For as long as I can remember, I've had these weird episodes. In my 28 years I still haven't been able to successfully describe it. They come out of nowhere, and changes the perception of Feel and sound. Anything I touch feels bigger/smaller or sometimes my fingers feel smaller and everything I hear sounds slightly faster and mad, if that makes any sense. I also start getting these really large amounts in my head and impossible tasks like trying to figure out equasions or trying to count a ridiculous amount of something. It does't happen as often as it did as when I was a child/teen but when it does I just feel unwell and it feels like it will never end. I'm not asking for a diagnoses, I just want to find out if there's a name for this or have a discussion with someone who has experienced it or is currently going through it. Also thinking back, it mostly happened at night

selftext: 33F here. I have been diagnosed with Complex PTSD. My 35M boyfriend has BPD. I know the 2 diagnosis’s are very similar. He and I have very similar childhoods and have experienced very similar ways of dealing and coping. We both go to DBT classes (separately)

Sometimes I feel as though I actually have BPD and not the PTSD. 

What are some key components that would separate me from the BPD diagnosis?

After the death of a loved one to suicide I started seeing a therapist. On several occasions she mentioned PTSD, but there was never any sort of official diagnosis. I would’ve thought there would’ve been more than just a few comments made. 🤷‍♀️

selftext: It's obvious that this medical failed is absolutely plagued nowadays, with everything from placebo pharmaceuticals to made up concepts. The issue with this subreddit is that there should be more stimulating conversations on what can be done to fix this, and how this thing can be turned around, rather than endless bitching and whining.

For example, if they would actually make tests every time, such as MRI's, brain scans and blood tests to determine hormonal levels and such, the costs and strain on the medical system would be exorbitant. No country is stupid enough to validate the applicability of these tests in the field of psychiatry. In the UK, anyone can do these tests if they suffer from a mental illness, but getting them for free under the NHS would be virtually a war lost before it even began.

These are the real problems that the field of psychiatry is facing today and it is problems like these that people should address. For example, the prescription of drugs such as Adderall or Ritalin without doing DOPAMINE LEVEL TESTING BEFOREHAND. But why would governments waste money on testing every single individual if they actually need those drugs, when they can just prescribe them to everyone like candy and cash in on the profits?

See my point? The system is absolutely broken, but I don't think it should be blamed on psychiatry as a medical science, but on the money grabbing governments and ignorant fools that do everything the doc says without questioning anything, and become mindless puppets trapped in the mental healthcare system, jumping from medication to medication and diagnosis to diagnosis without any understanding of the reality around them or any certifiable way of verifying the validity of their doctor's claims.

This is exactly the reason I subbed to this subreddit. For these kinds of conversations, such as "what is wrong", "what can be made better", or ideas on how to fix things. I feel awkward to repeat this (wrote it in the comments below), but sometimes this is starting to feel to me like I'm on the psychiatrist equivalent of r/incels.

EDIT: also, the most efficient way to make someone pay for a doctor, is tell them they are sick. Hence the enormity of conceptual personality disorders.

Everybody laugh this guy gave posts saying schizophrenia can be diagnosed with brain scans he went to go find the most biased psychiatric website journal and he ended up complete owning himself in the study they concluded inconclusive evidence that there’s a pathphysiological abnormality that demonstrates brain dysfunction as “schizophrenia”

selftext: Tw: other diagnoses

Before today I had never been formally diagnosed with anything. Although I have done extensive research on what could be wrong with me, counselors never really took me seriously and I have never made it more than a few sessions because it felt useless. 

I kinda had an idea what my diagnoses might be beforehand. Like I have been researching this crap for 5 yearson my own since none of the doctors would help me. 

Today I think that may have changed. 

Today, I met with a new psychiatrist. I was nervous because first visits are stressful. 

However for the first time ever, instead of ignoring the extensive paperwork I filled out and trying to get me to explain everything from scratch, (what my other counselors have done, and it always fails bc I filled out those dam papers for a reason and I cant just tell you all problems on the spot geez)

She looked at my paperwork and went over it with me in detail. It was rather relieving. 

At the end, she started talking about "diagnoses" and I nearly cried because no one has ever made it that far before. 

My thoughts in the past have wrestled between ASD and BPD (why I am here in the first place.)

She confirmed that it was likely one of the 2. (Again, almost cried)

However, I did learn that the 2 cannot coexist, since theu have a lot of similar symptoms yet fundamentally different brain chemistry. Which means I have to go get further testing out of town to confirm which one it is. 

My goodness, I almost have real answers!

selftext: I am a caucasian female, aged 21, 5'2 around 120lbs and I do not smoke. The only medication that I am currently taking is Yaz, and I've been on it continuously for around 4 years now. Additionally, I also have a copper IUD. I also have been diagnosed with IBS and have struggled with digestive issues throughout my entire life. My parents have also informed me that I was diagnosed with Achalasia when I was an infant as well.

So onto the issue that has been going on for around a year and a half now. Even if I get remotely hungry, I find myself becoming extremely bloated. It almost becomes painful and it makes me fairly nauseous as well. It feels as if it's occurring throughout my entire stomach/abdomen, and the only way to make it better is to take simethicone, or to burp. I am not joking, as that is how much of the pressure is relieved is solely through burping. I have seen a gastro doctor about this, but I was only prescribed probiotics and heartburn medication and those did not help in the slightest. The only thing that seems to bring this on is when I get hungry and then do not immediately eat. It's not as if I haven't eaten for four hours, it's like if I've only been hungry for around half an hour that this starts.

I am going back to the doctor here relatively soon but this issue is putting me at my wits end. Thanks for all the help!

selftext: My 8 year-old son has relatively mild behavioral issues at school. He’s been diagnosed with ADHD by two professionals, but his symptoms are not perfectly text book. 

My wife and I would be eager to hear all members’ experiences with Ritalin. We’re curious to hear the perspectives of users, parent of users, friends/relatives of users, etc. 

Ultimately, we’re hoping to get a feel for the risks and rewards involved. 

Personally, I believe my son is very similar to myself (no diagnosed ADHD, but wouldn’t be shocked if I could get a diagnosis) and can thus survive and/or thrive without meds. His school may not be as optimistic &amp;/or willing to deal with the challenging behavior.

Thank you, all!

selftext: My therapist diagnosed me with Adult ADHD Inattentive Type and recommended I either go to my Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner or my Primary Care dr for meds. He said it would probably help me with a lot of the issues I've been dealing with (I'm diagnosed with PTSD, Bi-Polar II, and Major Depressive Disorder). 

I'm 57, and I've known for quite some time I have had all the symptoms of ADHD - especially as a child. 

Well, I went to my Nurse Practitioner who prescribes psychiatric meds, and she literally laughed about it and didn't want to pursue it at all! She implied that ADHD is over-diagnosed and is "not an issue" for people my age. So I asked about seeing someone else who would help me, and she just shrugged and recommended a psychologist that would test me - again. I couldn't get around that with them (the counseling agency and her) no matter what I said - so I then went to my Primary Care Dr. 

He tested me and I was off the charts (wow, surprise, surprise), but because of my age (yeah - that again) and because I scored high on anxiety as well, he didn't want to prescribe stimulants which I was fine with. He prescribed Clonidine and said to get back with him in 2 weeks. It did nothing, so he increased the dosage, and said if that didn't work he'd try Straterra. 

Well, the increased dosage still did nothing, so I called back like I was instructed to do - and he suddenly behaved as tho I was just trying to get my hands on amphetamines, said he wasn't "comfortable" prescribing anything else for me, and to go thru - my prescribing nurse practitioner for meds! So much for trying Straterra, and why did he think I was drug-seeking when I didn't insist on stimulants and I was referred by my therapist? 

So I'm back to having to perhaps pay $300 to be tested again for ADHD (and I have to travel out of my own town to have it done - and my first therapist did not charge this fee but is in the same agency) and I'm just so frustrated. 

I have struggled with ADHD symptoms my entire life - I can't concentrate on any one thing, my thoughts are all over the place so that I've never been able to think straight (I've been called "scatter-brained" by teachers and other kids in my schools) and all I want is to experience what my son, who was diagnosed with ADHD himself, describes as suddenly having everything make sense to him and having a clarity of thought with the meds he'd never had before. I've lived with this my entire life and I don't think my age should prevent me from finding relief. Has anyone else around my age run into this? If so, how did you resolve it (if you did)? Will I have to resign myself to "alternative therapies" like CBT or are there other meds I don't know about? Any suggestions or advice are welcome!

TL;DR My dr and psychiatric prescriber won't prescribe ADHD meds for me because of my age, the presence of anxiety, and an implication that I'm drug-seeking (even tho my therapist diagnosed me). Grrrr!

selftext: Ok so to start, I have bpd. I wouldn't say it in the title otherwise lol. Anyways, upon being diagnosed, I've done a shit ton of reading on it. I wanted to learn and all. Anywhos
This dumb ass girl who feels the need to diagnose herself with everything she sees online, whom btw I've known for most of her life (I'm a couple years older than her) based on one post that had to do with depressive symptoms of bpd told me she "thinks" she has it.
Naturally I went off. Because she was diagnosing herself bipolar last week but saying her meds made her better within 5 days as if that actually happens. Then she said meds made her worse. She's pretty much what I like to call a self diagnosis Sally. 
She's a spoiled rich kid who gets whatever she wants whenever she wants. Cries over everything. Never had to work in her life. For anything. Never went through anything bad other than a couple of dudes dumping her. 
She has none of the symptoms except she sometimes is "impulsive and hostile" (yeah ok I totally believe this -eyeroll-). A big part of bpd is self destructive and harmful behaviors such as casual sex with multiple partners, self harm, suicide attempts, bingeing, irresponsible spending. She's done none of these. Says "her religion and asexuality keeps her from the sexual parts, she doesn't self harm, but she's thought about suicide and binge ate before." 
She constantly has new "disorders." Her NEW psychiatrist that she has only been seeing for a few months puts all this shit in her head. 
She's in high school mind you which can be a shitty time for all of us, but instead of dealing with her problems the right way, she finds diagnoses on the internet and thinks she has them. Yes high school causes anxiety for many. Sometimes we get bullied and it ends up making us depressed occasionally
But like what the frick, why does she need a mental illness label so badly? Last I checked it isn't fun lol
Sorry I needed to rant

selftext: I’m new to this sub. Here's my story:

I am 23 years old. I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when I was five years old. I was in special education classes all through grade school and I spent my whole childhood doing playgroups and summer camps for children on the autism spectrum. However, I never fit in with any of the kids in my autism playgroups, but I also never fit in with neurotypicals, either. I just existed, alone and friendless, in this sort of twilight zone. I just grew up feeling stupid and less than.

I was a problem child. I was disruptive, inattentive, could not sit still, cried a lot, got in trouble a lot... I needed aides to keep me in line. In middle school I had to have my mom check my assignment book for me every day to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. I missed assignments all the time. I was smart, I just never had it together. Miraculously though, I graduated high school AND college and managed to get decent grades.

A few years ago I did a lot of research and began suspecting that I don't actually have Aspergers, and instead have ADHD, which I was never formally diagnosed with. My folks diagnosed me themselves but what do they know?

I saw a neuropsychologist for testing earlier this month to determine if I actually have ADHD and not aspergers (even though it’s entirely possible to have both). I was also screened for anxiety and depression while there, and I should get my evaluation report back in a week or two.

Anyway, I told my dad that I got tested for ADHD and he just said: "Well, what good will that do you? You’re not in school anymore. You can’t get accommodations at your new job. There are no accommodations in the workplace. Are you trying to get drugs for it?”

I'm just gobsmacked that he would say that. I'm not looking for accommodations or special privileges, I'm just looking for closure and ways to treat it. I have this mental illness that has totally fucked up my life and continues to fuck up my life long after leaving school. I don’t have to be in school to be diagnosed. Possibly having ADHD on top of anxiety and depression is absolutely crippling, and they just don’t understand or care. They always say they are supportive of me but then get mad at me for having anxiety attacks or forgetting to do dishes.

TL;DR -- told my dad I was tested for adult ADHD and he just brushed it off because I wasn't diagnosed as a kid and thinks I just want special treatment.

selftext: Hello, reddit!

I was diagnosed with ADHD combined by a psychologist whom assured me that I've gone my entire life \(23 years\) with ADHD and that it was very obvious even on pen and paper of my past. I was arranged an appointment with a psychiatrist \(which was a 2 week wait on its own\) to start a treatment plan that consisted of medication and a therapist session every two weeks. 

During those two weeks I researched very heavily about what ADHD is and learned that with medication and therapy I could have a very drastic change in my life which made me excited to start seeing results! 

Though I ran into a little bit of a snag.. Maybe? I'm not really sure to be honest. From what I've read here on this subreddit, other forums, and even personal relatives who are diagnosed I came to the conclusion that stimulant medication is the most effective along\-side non\-stimulant medication such as Straterra. I'm typically pretty reluctant to take any kind of medication even when it comes to very simple stuff like Tums. Not really sure why that is, I've just never really liked the idea of medication. From what I've read, I learned that **most** people who are prescribed stimulants seem to have very successful stories and there is only very few who don't. Alongside that research I've learned that anti\-depressants are apparently hard to get on and even harder to get off. That scares the crap out of me, so I decided that I would rather not subject myself to that. 

First appointment with the psychiatrist, she immediately tries to prescribe me Wellbutrin, which I read is used in the treatment of ADHD but less common and isn't FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD. So I tell her that my relationship with my parents and the research I've done over the past two weeks has made me very reluctant to try anti\-depressants and she said she doesn't prescribe anything else because they are too habit forming. I didn't quite understand what she meant so I asked her to elaborate, and she was telling me that I was going to abuse anything else, doing more harm than good.

My background is embarrassing when it comes to 'social norms'. I don't like drinking, I've never liked feeling drunk or tipsy. I've spent most of my life in front of my computer instead of going out being extremely uncomfortable around other people who are drunk. I'm not sure why she would assume I'm going to abuse a medication, and to be honest it actually kind of hurt my feelings. She told me she never prescribes anything other than Wellbutrin, which made me at first feel fine because I understood that she is the Doctor and I am the patient, and that I would just need to get a second opinion. ***But.. She treated me like I was an addict, threw my entire case away and told me to go somewhere else meaning I have to be re\-diagnosed because the psychologist who diagnosed me works in the same office.***

So now I'm back at square one. I'm on very low income because my symptoms are quite severe, so I'm struggling to find help while still being able to afford it.

I'm tempted to give up on seeking help after this, I need convincing otherwise. :/

selftext: I (27M) am diagnosed with adult depression and acute anxiety disorder. I also am pretty sure that I have adult ADHD but I haven't been diagnosed. I can hardly concentrate on anything (work, books, video games, anything) for an extended period of time and I also am pretty bad at paying attention to what's going on around me unless I super focus on it. My depression is like an angry dog walking along side of me every day and it chooses when to maul me, and then I slump into a dissociative depressive state for sometimes weeks at a time. I have always been the last one to finish assignments and tests, and throughout grade school I was always told to hurry up. I have dropped out of college 3 times and now I can't afford to go because I can't get financial aid and I just work in kitchens and restaurants because I have nowhere else to go. Sometimes I get the feeling that because of these things I am just ill-equipped for this world and I have nothing to do but continue failing at everything that I try.. I just don't know what to do.

selftext: Hi, 

I'm a university student with horrible memory and was diagnosed with dyslexia in middle school.  I have also been depressed since my teens and after a real awful episode two years ago I went to a Doc. He told me that I had heavy to mid range levels of depression and that my horrible memory could be pseudodementia. I was used to not being able to remember faces and names, but it got scarier when I couldn't remember whole trips with friends that just had happened last year or having this feeling of uncertainty if I told somebody something already or already did something.   

Right now I have different assignments to write essays and such. But for some reason, every time I try to remember the right way to write a word or how to structure a sentence I just can't. I asked two people two proof read my last paper and both told me that it's horrible. I had a bad feeling already while writing it but couldn't see what I was doing wrong. It feels like there is just a big mess in my head and so much white noise that I can not, for the life of me, remember how it was supposed to be. 

So I'm not even sure if this is a issue with me being diagnosed with dysalexia, ADD, depression or pseudodementia. For all I know it could be because of the whole package.  

Anybody else got diagnosed with pseudodementia or has similar problems? Could really need some tipps and tricks on how to work with it. I have to write my Bachelor thesis soon and can't stop procrastinating. I just know that I'll write some thoughts with zero structure.  Really trying not to get bumped out by the whole thing and stick to my schedule. So that I can start my Masters next year but it's though since I don't know what causes this problem and how to fix it.

selftext: 1. I will be heading back to GuangZhou China for my art studies, this is really important to me, i am diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger earlier in the year and have been on 15mg of dexamphetamine per day.

2. I can only get a month's supply each time and from my research amphetamine seems to be illegal in china, is there a substitute and if not then:

- what is the best way to cope with the four months overseas? i used to have a crazy coca cola addict but obviously it's super unhealthy and the effect only lasts while i am drinking it. I do not drink or smoke, would coffee be better? or some sort of herbs and what not that i can have access to in china?

- I currently don't know if i have grown a drug dependency because i take it everyday and have never tried to be off it, should i began by practising that since there is still 2 months before i need to go back.

Edit: However i do not have any urge to take my medication, i just take it because i feel it might help, sometimes i am not even sure if it does or if it's just placebo, and i have never over-dosed, more often than not i forgot to take it until it's too late lol.

- I consulted my psychiatrist and he said even if it was legal in china i would need to be re-diagnosed after my one month of supplies ran out, and i think that would cost me way too much money in china..
 
Thanks in advance.


TLDR: as the title states, staying overseas for four months

selftext: Basically, I'm a germaphobe and whenever I masturbate, I end up wasting a load of time checking for semen. 
I'll look up and down my clothes, bed, the toilet etc for semen and I'll sniff them to make sure I have no semen on me. I have to check everything I touch (e.g door handle ) for semen , despite it being touched with my clean hand etc. 

I don't have the compulsions as in checking multiple times even though I know it is clean, but I end up wasting about an hour after I've finished masturbating to when I've checked everything. 

I know I could stop masturbating, but I can see this being a problem when having sex in the future. Also, I hate when people touch my school work . I have to check that it is clean and not bent as well as a few other things. 

I think this started a few years ago and it was much worse then, that if I carried on doing these 'checks' I would probably have been diagnosed with OCD. I haven't been diagnosed with OCD. Maybe my Dad, who is a Doctor just thinks I'm a germaphobe and a bit of a weirdo (I admit I'm a bit odd, but proud of it). 

Should I just try to not do these checks? Just wash my hands, shower and that's it. If I just resist, will it go away? Do I actually have OCD? People say they're organised and clean , so they have OCD , but that's just not true. Do I need to see or talk to someone? Thanks .

Someone I'm seeing has ADHD and mentioned that his personality changes depending on if and when he's taken Ritalin, and that the comedown was particularly bad.

He's always careful to schedule dates on days/times when he doesn't need Ritalin or has recovered so I've never seen him on it. I'm curious to what degree his personality changes but don't want to ask him just yet.

My assumption is that the number one thing they would teach you in therapy is the answer to that question.  But after reading this question so many times, I wonder if anyone is teaching it.  If they are not teaching that, then what are they teaching?

selftext: Morning anxiety is my literal nightmare. I’ve had it for as long as I remember, even before I was diagnosed or even really knew what anxiety was or meant. 

To begin with it was just this crushing feeling of BAD. Like everything in the world was wrong and I was the reason for it. And all I wanted was a hug but even that seemed daunting. Especially when I would sleep over with someone else. I’d wake up feeling unwelcome and alone and afraid. 

It evolved over time to be exhausting physical pain, even full blown panic attacks as soon as I was awake remotely, but all of that came with the panic disorder and PTSD I was later diagnosed with. But does anyone else experience the feelings of doom i described? How do you work around it?

selftext: First of all, sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, if so let me know and I'll remove it. I'm going to get right into it, but if you think more backstory is needed in order to understand the situation better I'll add it in later. Also sorry if some things aren't properly explained, English is not my first language.

My [18F] mother [57F] has been struggling with dementia for 3 years; she used to work as a high school teacher and now works as a sort of secretary in the same school, however recently (meaning a month at most) she has been showing growing signs of schizophrenia and paranoia: at first she thought some students were shouting insults and profanities at her in the corridors, then that another secretary, who is undoubtedly a nasty person, was inciting this behaviour and also following her home and talking badly about her to the neighbours. It started with her only hearing voices, but lately she told us that she saw this secretary in our driveway or on the bus (yes her driver's license also got suspended, and she has never really gotten over it, understandably). 

So my father brought her to a doctor two weeks ago, who diagnosed her with schizophrenia (but without telling her) and prescribed her meds "for anxiety"; at first she refused to take them no matter what we said, but then all of a sudden she decided to start the therapy. However, things only escalated from there: she started seeing things more often, accusing my father of having an affair with the secretary (he has never even met her), telling me she doesn't trust him anymore and what's worse she started talking to herself from time to time, saying things like "go away!" or "leave me alone!"

Now I really don't understand how the pills could possibly have made her condition worse, I suspect she's maybe taken them once or twice and has been throwing them away ever since. Also she's convinced she's perfectly sane and that we, her own family, are against her and lying when we gently try to explain that maybe she's just confusing a few things. Honestly I'm really worried about her chances of improvement if she keeps thinking all of this is real, and also that she'll start talking about these things at work, so in the end my question is: how should I behave when she talks to me about her delusions? 

Should I try to gently make her reason like I've been doing until now? Should I just go along with it or avoid the matter entirely (I suppose this is the worst course of action, but then again I'm really at a loss here)? Should I go straight to the point and tell her it's all in her head, make her look up schizophrenia and insist she should see a therapist (though honestly if she doesn't want to it's not like we can force her)? Or should I do something else entirely? Sorry for the wall of text and thanks in advance for any advice.

selftext: I remember the first time my GP sent me to a psychiatrist she asked a couple of question in a very flat fashion, recommended pills for anxiety (I refused) and sent me to a psychologist. Neither of them gave me any official diagnose (I was seeing him for two years) and my psychologist never dig deeply into what else I struggled with as to see possible connections. (Though he always tried to make conclusions from me living with just one parent and in my opinion other irrelevant things.)

What **I care about is finding out a diagnose as to properly address my issues** (deep set of long-term problems that have worsened over time and are negatively influencing my life, so it's likely it's some sort of a hidden disorder - the therapy back then didn't help me one bit and he always used to say that there's something "odd about me" but never could figure out what was it) but I don't want medication (don't need it).

How do I go about this? If I make a date at a psychologist, do I have to ask if they make some **tests for diagnoses**? (I know that some take months of observation to figure out, but I've heard often from friends that they got diagnosed at a spot or I see companies offering a psycho-diagnostic standalone.)

Should I **make a date at just any psychologist**? I read in threads that some psychologist won't be able to say A from B if they don't specialize in it and might misdiagnose, but in my city it seems cluttered with a couple of psychiatrists who have in their bio rather fully generic things (problems at work, family, relationships, low self-esteem, ...)

selftext: I was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago by my family doctor, who prescribed SSRIs \(which I never took\). My moods range from suicidal and self harming to just feeling out of sorts and not at peace with myself. Sometimes I go months without feeling like that, sometimes it seems to come about every few weeks and lasts for weeks at a time.

I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression. I wonder if I'm faking it or blowing my feelings out of proportion, especially comparing it to more serious cases of mental illness.

Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do you deal with it?

I have been having random skipped heartbeats for about a year maybe more. But it'll usually be about once or twice a day. Just randomly. Recently (last june) me and my mom have started counting calories on MyFitnessPal. We get 1200 calories a day so I've cut back on a lot of food and soda. Instead of 3 colas a day, I drink 1 diet with dinner. 

Anyways, cut to last night after dinner I went upstairs to clean our catbox and sat on my bed to look at my phone for a minute. My heart started skipping a bunch of beats. Like 7 times within a minute or two. I could feel it skipped in my chest, and it was interesting to be able to hold my fingers to my vein on my throat and feel it stop the pulse for a second. After that I went downstairs told my mom it was kinda cool and then came back up to start the catbox. It continued to skip beats when I was cleaning and a couple times after I was finished. It skipped about 20+ times within 10ish minutes. I wasn't dizzy or feeling faint so I didn't really think it was bad. 

I was just wondering if this was something I should go to my normal dr to check out, or if its just normal. Thanks!

selftext: Hi guys, I'm a college sophomore who was diagnosed with ADHD-PI a year ago. I made horrible grades my first semester, so I thought there must be something wrong with me. My Dad has ADHD, I've always been pretty lazy and unmotivated, and I have a bit of a substance abuse issue. So I thought it all added up.

I went to see a psychiatrist and she asked me like 5 questions, and within a few minutes I was diagnosed with ADHD. That's the part that really bugs me. How can you determine someone has ADHD with such little context? And the thing is, I picked the wrong major when I started college. I majored in computer science which was a huge mistake, as my real passion is neuroscience. If I had started as a neuroscience major, I'm positive my grades would've been great, and the diagnosis would not have been made. 

Anyway, I think the reason why I'm disorganized, prone to procrastination, and unfocused might be because of depression rather than ADHD. One thing I've noticed is that whenever I'm happier, whether it's because of drugs or because something positive happened in my life, my ADHD basically goes away. I'm more productive and motivated, to the point where it's not an issue anymore. So I stopped taking my Adderall prescription, because I just felt incredibly guilty. I felt like I was cheating at college/life. 

Has anyone else felt this way? Trying to decide whether to continue medication or not. Thanks for any help.

selftext: The psychiatrist diagnosed me with anxiety and not ADHD. She said she thinks I have ADHD but I need to fill out a questionnaire to be certain. She instead prescribed me Buspar (Buspirone). I felt like a zombie the first day I took it. It did not help my focus or motivation levels whatsoever but made it worse to the point I felt like a zombie.

Has anyone had a similar experience where you had to go back for a followup to be prescribed with ADHD? I believe she was very cautious because she said due to the opiod epidemic and that abuse mentality she is cautious to prescribe stimulants.

I have anxiety for sure. If I do end up being diagnosed as ADHD will I be taking an anti anxiety and something like adderall at the same time?

selftext: I got diagnosed last August after trying to in June of 2016 and getting anxiety meds which obviously didn’t work. When I was diagnosed I started taking medication it really helped but for the past six months I’ve felt like I’ve been at a wall and losing progress. Especially in my relationship with my S/O. 

Now I need more help. I need a therapist or something, but fuck it’s so hard to admit that there is something wrong with me that can’t be fixed with a pill and well wishes. It is just so hard to admit that I need more help than my friends and family can provide.

selftext: I am fully (hopefully) recovered. I am simply asking for opinions.

When I was around 7, I had a general slip. I fell and hit the back of my spine on a normal table. Later on, I complained of back pains in the lower part of my spine.

After this, I fell randomly a lot. I could be crossing the road or simply walking, etc. Teachers begun to complain as I couldn’t walk up the stairs without being tired.

As part of the curriculum, it’s mandatory for kids to learn how to swim. We did this in the local swimming baths. I couldn’t walk and would lag behind. The distance between I and the class was catastrophic. 

My mother decided to take me to hospital. The first time I was misdiagnosed, the second I was diagnosed with to MASSIVE fractures and I also was diagnosed with scoliosis. I also had no sense of balance. My mobility of the left side of my body was also significantly worse than the  right. I also had absolutely no reflexes.

Over the next few weeks, I was watched closely. I was under the nerve, spinal and bone clinics. I had 4 EMG tests all to which had no result, 2 lumbar punctures both of which had no result and two biopsies - one on my thigh and one on my hip - and they had no result. They took skin and muscle.

I was confined to a wheelchair and was unable to go to school. I was given a spinal cast. I was given a long course of prednisolone - I think - because I had been diagnosed with inflamed nerves. These made me return to hospital as they seemingly worsened my condition. They stopped it. 

I had bone density tests and I was told that my vitamin d and c levels were low. I assumed vitamin d levels were low because of the climate I live in (UK). 

After that, I still tried to build up strength. I went to a biking club that was directed towards disabled people and was able to begin to regain my mobility. After about 3 and a bit years, I was able to walk again. As of 2018, my spine is only 3 degrees into the considered range of osteoporosis, I have reflexes, balance and mobility. I’m still not as athletic as everyone else but it’s a lot better than I was.

I was left undiagnosed by doctors and I still am to this day.

If you read this, thanks a lot. Opinions are greatly appreciated.

I'm in University and exam season is just around the corner, even though I can open a textbook and study from it for hours (Thank for god Vyvanse), I have no motivation to do so and just end up playing League or stay in bed all day.

I've never considered that I was depressed due to the fact I don't feel "sad". However, many of the symptoms expressed in this forum I share such as: 
feeling irritable and intolerant of others 
having no motivation or interest in things
continuous low mood or sadness
feeling hopeless and helpless
having low self-esteem 
no interest in maintaining hygeine

I've been on Zoloft before but had to come off it due to it reducing the efficiency of Vyvanse for social anxiety in which it worked wonders. Also, I was much happier on Zoloft.

Are the symptoms cause by depression or ADHD? Is there a strict guideline of which depression can be diagnosed?

I checked that I am being treated for anxiety/depression and they want to know specifically the date of onset, duration, and degree of recovery. 

I mean...shit I was diagnosed 13 years ago. Depression/anxiety runs in my family so I was depressed long before I was diagnosed. I never looked at my medical records from back then so Idk what it says. I was living in another state. All I know is I was depressed, a doctor prescribed me Zoloft in 2005, it made me feel better, and 13 years later I'm still managing really well with Zoloft. I have no idea what I'm supposed to put next to "degree of recovery". As long as I take my meds, I'm good. If I went off my meds, I wouldn't feel good.

So there's like my actual thoughts as one layer, my intrusive thoughts as another layer, and then this weird noise as a third layer. This only used to happen when I was trying to fall asleep, but it's been happening more while I'm awake since I went on Luvox 4 days ago. Could it possibly be from the lack of sleep I'm getting from this ssri? I've only been sleeping like 4-6 (at most) hours because this medication is making me super energetic and jittery. When I'm fully awake this doesn't seem to happen though, but I'm legitimately worried about my mental health. My OCD themes are intrusive thoughts about Schizophrenia and going crazy. 

One thing that stands out to me is the staring into space, and replaying conversations and talking to myself... This usually happens when I'm busy or preoccupied as well.

I've gone on to some websites for early onset symptoms to check if I share any of the symptoms to Schizophrenia and it seems like I do. Anyone have any insight? I had my ERT therapist tell me I don't have Schizophrenia but is she allowed to really diagnose it?

selftext: TLDR: I have had a gradually increasing pain in my testicles (mostly the left one) over the past several months. I saw a doctor 3 months in and after a 30 second feel he told me to wear tighter underwear and take tylenol when it hurts. Since then the pain has gone from a dull ache, to sometimes a stabbing pain the spreads to my legs and lower back. I would like to see a new doctor but was unsure if i should see a special kind of doctor?
Male, Age: 22 Race: White
Location: Missouri, United States.
Height: about 5'7" Weight: about 250lbs
Medications: I was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia about 2 years ago and take lots of prescribed medication for it. MORNING: (4.5mg Vraylar) NIGHT: (600mg Lithium Carbonate) + (200mg Lamotragine). Because of the amounts I NEVER put any other medications into my body. Not even OTC painkillers. All 3 medications are currently prescribed by my psychiatrist, separate from the earlier mentioned doctor. I do not smoke cigarettes.
DETAILS:
So about 6 months ago I started to notice a dull ache in my balls. For awhile i ignored it but over 2 or 3 months it got to the point where i was regularly uncomfortable. I saw a doctor and after a quick feel, he told me that since i was not discharging anything it was likely because i often wear baggy underwear and pants. I left unsatisfied with the diagnosis but not really wanting to pursue this rather embarrassing issue any further, i decided he was right and i just needed to hope it would go away.
Now its been almost 4 months since that appointment and things have gotten worse. These are the symptoms I am currently experiencing:
-Changing levels of pain in one or both testicles. This pain often radiates to my legs, stomach, or lower back.
-Darkened veins around my left testicle.
-Sometimes i can feel a lump on my left testicle but other times it seems to disappear or i cant find it.
-General tiredness. I just feel lethargic all the time. I realize for someone at my weight this may seem normal but its been worse recently.
-Loss of appetite. I have to force myself to eat the maybe 1.5 meals a day ive been eating the past few weeks.
Im not a doctor. Not even close, so im not going to try and diagnose myself. But from the light research ive done, im starting to think i may have testicular cancer. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer last year but made a full recovery (they got to it early) and i know cancer risk can be genetic so the more i look up symptoms the more sure i am. wich brings me to my main question:

WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR SHOULD I SEE?

Are there doctors that specialize in testicular cancer? or testicles in general? should I go to a cancer specialist or would that be assuming too much? Are there tests that can be done to determine if i have cancer, and what would they be?
Any help is much appreciated. Right now i plan to look up and call whatever kind of doctor is recommended here tomorrow and schedule an appointment for Wednesday. So any info before then would be great.

I know she’s been through, and is going through an outrageous challenge as far as mental health goes. She mirrors me 4 years ago, and I can’t stand it. 

I know she was diagnosed as bipolar, but she gives me this “I’m bipolar, and there’s nothing I can do about it” attitude. Doesn’t listen to me when I offer her suggestions, just wants me to baby her almost! I know she’s been through a lot, but so have I. She puts a complete wall up when it comes to hearing me out on the trauma I’ve been through, and ways to ease through it. 

I myself was diagnosed once as bipolar, and after seeking help - it is more of a fight or flight mode, post trauma since childhood. I’m doing stuff about it, and bettering myself. 

She’s drinking, a lot. We were out together with friends, and my sister who was visiting and she lost her shit on me while she was plastered. I told her that her drinking hits a nerve that I have put away, and I’m not going to put up with it. We’ve been distant since, but she’s still “You don’t understand, nothing you say will change me” 

It’s hard to deal with this. I know she can be a good person, but it’ll be a long time before she tries to water that garden in her sense of well being, and I feel like I’m being degraded and played like there’s no tomorrow.

Me being the empathetic person that I am, am still hanging around. I hear her out but am not giving her what she wants. It’s hard, as it’s becoming a fake friendship. There’s not much I can do, but I feel guilty like I’m abandoning her almost.

selftext: Ever since I was little, I've always had anxiety issues. I always thought that it was just me being a wimp, or maybe I was broken. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder three years ago, at first I thought it was stomach issues, but the further I looked into it I realized what I had and I went to a professional. Being diagnosed was scary, I felt different, I often had people tell me to "man up" or to "stop overthinking" but to me those concepts were impossible. There would be nights that my brain would just spiral into this dark pit of dispair and loneliness, my brain would make up these scenarios and I would obsess over them until my parents got out of bed and I felt free and safe. I went to therapy, I realized that I wasn't alone. There are millions of people just like me, who suffer the same illness. Although we have different backgrounds, it's our one definite commonality. I still deal with my anxiety to this day, (in fact today was one of the worst anxiety attacks I've had in months) but the realization that I'm not alone, that all the thoughts I have hold no weight; is comforting. I'm going to deal with this the rest of my life, but having the self awareness really helps me. We're all human, we are all crazy in our own special way; we're all fighting for one goal, to see tomorrow. And I think the fight is well worth it.

selftext: Hi all, I've been lurking for a while and I thought I'd ask you guys about this, because I'm not sure where to start. 

(I don't think I'm breaking rules as I'm not asking you guys for a diagnosis, so I hope I'm in the clear!!)

I'm 32/f and living in the UK. Over the last few years I've begun to suspect I have ADHD, or a similar condition. Reading your posts, I've found myself relating a lot to what you all talk about. 

I'm also very aware that's it's super easy to diagnose yourself with anything on the internet, and maybe I don't have anything at all. 

I'm wondering what's the best way to get assessed in the UK? I don't think my GP is going to be very receptive. I tried to get assessed a few years ago, and it all blew up. Lots of accusations of me 'just being depressed' and 'looking to blame your problems on something else'. It was a mess, and I'd rather avoid it. 

I'm guessing I'll have to go the private route, which is gonna cost a good chunk, so I need to start saving now. What's the best way to find a specialist, and how do you know you're getting someone legit? I've seen a few websites online that look less than reputable, but tell me they can diagnose me.

I'm just kind of at a loss, so if you have any ideas where I should start, I'd really appreciate it!

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD on the NHS about a year and a half ago.  
  
When my ADHD doctor discharged me to my GP, he said that he thought I might benefit from some therapy for my social anxiety and referred me to their clinical psychologist.   
  
I see her a month later and she mentions that she runs a 6 week long course for ADHD people, one class a week.  
  
Each class is two hours long and focuses on a different topic like:  
  
- Health and wellbeing  
- Time management  
- Procrastination  
- Emotions  
- Dealing with stress  
  
I went to the first class this week and there's just 5 of us, all diagnosed as adults. She talks about all the different ways ADHD can affect things like our diet and sleep.   
  
Everyone in the room is so excited to share their experiences and stories that we all keep interrupting each other. It's so nice to meet other ADHD folk face to face.   
  
Anyway, I think the fact that this class exists is *amazing*! Plus it's totally free on the NHS too which I am blown away by. I feel so lucky that support like this is out there. It's a drop in the ocean but a small step towards better ADHD awareness and treatment.   
  
**Tl;dr - The NHS have an ADHD course just for ADHD people to teach us better life-management skills and I think it's an awesome idea :)**

selftext: I wasn't diagnosed until I was 22 because I was the typical quiet, smart, inattentive girl. I was very hyperactive as a child but I grew out of it so I slipped through the cracks as many of us do.

It sucks knowing that I could've been diagnosed earlier and I could've avoided doing a lot of things that negatively impacted my life. The biggest example I can give is how badly I messed up my GPA my first 3-4 years of college and now it's nearly impossible to bring it up due to how saturated it is, I've taken too many credits for anything to make much of a difference now. And given that I'm trying to get into med school, things feel pretty hopeless much of the time and it's very depressing knowing that I am not living up to my potential due to this.

My SO's son probably has ADHD but my SO is apprehensive about getting him evaluated and possibly put on medication. It's hard seeing them struggle - I feel for my SO and it is mentally exhausting on both of us when his son is bouncing off the walls, talking non-stop, and constantly interrupting... but I also empathize with his son because I understand exactly what it's like to be constantly forgetting things or acting carelessly (my SO gets very frustrated with this and gets upset with him a lot).

**TL;DR - do you wish you would've been diagnosed as a child? And those that were, do you feel like that's made a difference in your life?**


edit: I didn't expect so many responses and i've been reading every single one as they come in! thank you guys so much for sharing your experiences :)

selftext: Last therapy session my therapist and I talked about whether I'm just more productive or if it's a sign of hypomania. I'm currently on an antipsychotic (risperdal) only. He mentioned that my psychiatrist may need to check whether I need a mood stabilizer on my next visit but he gave the all-clear initially. I can only remember one longer episode of what could have been hypomania that was two years ago(before I started psychotherapy) and one instance where I was more outgoing and less introverted one evening but then went right into psychosis.

The reason we talked about it was because since I had increased my risperdal four weeks ago I suddenly became overly productive after the paranoia has passed and I'm have much more focus and mental clarity. He said if it was hypomania it would't last longer than a few days before my mental state starts to get worse, which did not happen.

I'm now worried because I now got less stuff done this week. But I think I overthink that and I just got scared because my therapist threatened me with more pills...

I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder but I never was prescribed an antidepressant or mood stabilizer. I've heard that risperdal has mood stabilizing properties so maybe they cover my affective part enough. I've had depressive episodes but they came often after psychosis and since I got better at preventing psychosis they're less of a problem. My therapist is not sure about the affective part of my disorder yet. I guess it's just a "too high functioning and a more episodic course so no schizophrenia diagnosis" thing.

So any insights from you would be appreciated. I need to take my meds and go to sleep so I will be back tomorrow.

selftext: You often hear that in most cases people with schizophrenia don't realize they are (becoming) ill, atleast in the beginning. 

What if you are a person who is going to develop schizophrenia in the future  who already knows what most (early) symptoms are before you actually get those symptoms, is it more likely that you do see it coming in this case? Or will you most likely still not notice you are getting ill? Anyone here who did see their schizophrenia coming before anyone else around them who can say how it went?

Can someone also give me some perspective on how one would think their halucinations are real? I read a lot for example that, early on, people hear voices from people who aren't actually here. Common one I hear is people hearing their boss at random times. What goes through ones mind usually to not realize that it clearly doesn't make sense and that the person is halucinating? Or do most people realize it at that stage?

Just wanna make clear that I'm definitely not asking these questions to self-diagnose. I'm genuinely curious and info might come handy for people around me or maybe even me in the future.

selftext: Every time it's the same thing. I start by feeling offended, hurt, disappointed at something he does. When he points out that I actually did something that hurt/offended him first, I get defensive. I cannot accept that I am wrong. I cannot listen to him explain to me why his feelings were hurt. I demand things go my way and he apologizes to me first. (Keep in mind I'm not doing all of this intentionally. I realize it afterwards.) When he doesn't feel validated or listened to, he refuses to give in to me. This sends me into a downward spiral. I begin to hate him. I begin to hate myself. I hate him more for making me hate myself. I wonder what I did to make him hurt me this way. I start to wonder if I'm just a horrible person. I imagine breaking up with him for making me feel this way. I don't want to break up with him. I still can't understand why he won't just listen to me. I find it impossible to think about how he's feeling. Until I do. Then I feel guilty. I come down. I tell him I'm ready to listen. He tells me what I did wrong. I ask how to fix it. He tells me. I say okay. I say I'm sorry, he says he's sorry. We hug.

Then, round 2.

I hate myself all over again. I sink down low. I think of all that he said and I wonder why I can't just understand like a normal person does. I wonder why my brain doesn't function the way his does apparently. I wonder if other people have this problem. I wonder if other couples have these issues.

I want to kill myself and eliminate the problem from the equation. Free him from all the trouble I caused him. I grab him and I hug him tight because I worry that I'm slipping away. He holds me and tells me I'll be alright.

I've been to 3 therapists(technically, 2 psychologists and a psychotherapist) in the last year. I told all 3 the same things. I want to be diagnosed. I want to know my diagnoses. I want to be treated. This is serious. I have not received any formal testing or a diagnoses.

I've been (assumably) with depression and anxiety since I was ~10, but I have memories of depression from earlier than that. I went to a child therapist for 2 years, as well as 2 therapists in high school. I am now 23 and have never been treated more than being asked to buy and read The Feeling Good Handbook. My issue with this book. It works fine if I'm at a 2/5. I can use the worksheets, fully understand and be coherent. But when I'm at a 5/5, no worksheets can make me convince myself that I am worth life.

I believe I have worse than depression and anxiety. I worry sometimes that I have BPD. But some of the symptoms sound right and some sound very wrong. 

DISCLAIMER. I am not looking for a legal, medical diagnoses. I am seeking people who have similar feelings to mine and what they may or may not have so I have something to research and bring up at my next appointment as a possibility.  Any advice on how to get a damn diagnoses from my therapists would also be great.

Thankfully at the age of 21 I'm almost done with college and have four great friends (I've known two for 4 years), however two of them simply don't get aspergers.  When I express to them frustration about issues I face or the fact that I can be poorly treated they simply deny it.  Just yesterday I mentioned that people sometimes distrust aspies because some of our mannerisms seem "untrustworthy" to neurotypical people, they said that it's false.  I'm honestly really frustrated that my friends won't even try to understand.  They seem to blame me by saying that it's because I'm a pessimist.

I started taking the respective pills for them. The most noticeable changes were that my depression and mood swings stopped. However, going to a new psychiatrist this year, he discarded the pill I took for depression and replaced it with another pill that was also supposed to treat bipolarity. I have yet to see any difference with it. Should I keep taking this pill eventhough my bipolarity has already been effectively treated by another one?

Sleep has ALWAYS been an issue for me and I've been on some sort of something almost my entire life.  I was only diagnosed very recently, as an adult, but the sleep stuff finally made sense. 

Mine is mostly racing thoughts. Not worry, but just thinking about ALL THE THINGS.

Starting exercise helped a lot but since going on meds, the sleep has gotten a bit harder, even when taking melatonin on some nights. I eat a fairly balanced diet. And take pre\-biotics daily.

Anything else fellow ADHDers do to help? Not necessarily medicine, lifestyle things.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression issues. There is no singular traumatizing episode from my past, but the symptoms I have seem to reflect some sort of minor traumas that have impacted me. I have bad depersonalization/derealization and find myself dissociating a lot. I also have many generalized fears about safety and being alone. Do you find it more helpful to look forward and not analyze the past trying to understand your illness or is it helpful to go back over your past, that doesn’t contain one severely traumatic event, instead?

But the fact that out of the dozens only one thing can be diagnosed is a *wee* fuckin bit disappointing. I can't help but picture my future like this:





Me:

Coroner: * cuts me open * "wow, if only they'd caught these diseases sooner :c "

Let me cut to the case - I was diagnosed with anxiety four years ago although I had been having panic attacks since the age of 8. I'm 20 now, with the anxiety comes depression and borderline personality disorder.
I'm about to attend auditions for my dream university in February and move to that country in September. I can't travel, I get panic attacks and leave the bus immediately. Any advice for travel and moving anxiety?
I'm in therapy and on meds so I'm working through those things, I just need a back up plan.

tl;dr - travel/moving anxiety, any tips?

HI there! 

I was diagnosed a few months ago with a Hiatal Hernia, and I have a few questions I want some help with. First some background. I have suffered with heartburn symptoms for years now. In January, I went to a gastro doctor, who promptly performed an endoscopy on me, and I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. Other then heartburn, I have had no symptoms, or so I thought. For the past several months, dating back before the initial diagnosis, I've felt this occasional odd feeling in my chest. Its hard to describe, but I shall do my best. It rarely hurts, and when it does, its a mere twinge or pinch. Sometimes, especially when I cough deeply, it feels like a little spasm. Mostly, it just feels like something is there. Like someone is rubbing their fingers gently against the area. I didnt pay it much mind, but its just persistent enough that I think i should get it looked at. However, after recent thought, I put 2+2 together, and realized its probably just the hernia. I didnt mention it with my doctor prior to my endoscopy because it simply wasn't a big enough deal at the time to even mention. Recently, I put 2+2 together and realized im probably feeling the hernia. I even looked at an anatomy diagram, and sure enough, the feeling is right where the esophageal sphincter is located. BUT, Im not a doctor and I cannot say for sure. I have to wait two weeks to see my doctor, and Im actually getting a bit nervous. Does anyone else here had similar symptoms as I have had? Im just worried, or even say paranoid, that its something really severe.

selftext: Hello!

I am a 58\-year\-old human male, and I was diagnosed with ADHD less than a year ago. I won't write my autobiography here, but suffice it to say that I have always been this way, but didn't know until last year that "this way" is ADHD. Once I was diagnosed, my psychiatrist started me on mixed amphetamine salts, eventually going up to 60 mg per day, but I couldn't really tell whether it was working. I tried methylphenidate next, and that's what I'm taking now: ER, 54 mg. I can tell a bit of difference in that I can better catch myself being distracted, but it interferes with my sleep a bit, and my wife says I'm a bit more cranky. \(She also says that I'm so nice most of the time that "cranky" isn't really very cranky.\) 

I have heard a fair number of testimonials from people who said that being on medication let them experience the "neurotypical" brain for the first time...but neither the amphetamine salts nor the methylphenidate have done that for me. I was on an antidepressant \(SSRI\) for a while years ago, and I hated it, both for the way it made me feel and for the side effects, so I don't want to try anything that works that way. 

I have some questions about the experiences other people have had with meds.

1. Have other people had similar experiences with meds, in which they seem to help with alertness, but not much else?
2. Do very many diagnosed people decide not to take meds at all? 
3. If mixed amphetamine salts didn't do anything for me, would the prodrug version \(Vyvanse\) be different from that? 
4. I understand that "the pill is not the skill." What can I reasonably expect ADHD medication NOT to do? What do realistic expectations look like\&gt;

Thanks in advance to anyone who has some light to shed; I would love to be able to get some relief from the troublesome parts of ADHD without losing out on the good parts.

selftext: I was recently triggered about a story of a woman receiving a false-positive drug test and it ruining her reputation. 

I was diagnosed as HIV+ a few years back. I received a message from a local clinic saying I may have been exposed to a deadly virus and I need to come in for testing. They diagnosed me with syphilis and HIV+. I displayed no symptoms that would indicate being sick. I came in for treatment several times while awaiting an appointment with an HIV specialist before they told me I actually didn't have syphilis. Miscommunication on their end. or a bad test. hell if they knew. I finally saw a doctor who told me I'd likely been "sick" with HIV for years, and that I had 6 months to live unless I started meds now. I did not care (or trust him) and opted not to medicate.

My life was kinda spiraling before the diagnosis (not health related) so i took this as the universe showing me the way out. I was totally fine with dying...BUT I didn't die. I did not become physically debilitated. I did not get sick. I did not develop any symptoms of..anything. Nothing I was told to expect happened. I am actually in the best health I've ever been in. However, I am emotionally fractured and idk how to come back from such a traumatizing experience. I didn't really recognize it until I watched a program about PTSD and realized that I've been experiencing it ever since that diagnosis.

help.

selftext: I hope I worded the title right, not quite sure how else to phrase it.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD along with anxiety (can get severe) last year (in my 40's .. and just diagnosed) and both the psychiatrist and family doctor had talked about Vyvanse. So I started taking it in the spring of last year. I did fairly well on it. It also elevated my mood, not too high or low, just literally felt "normal" and happy. Although I was prescribed 80mg (40mg morning and 40mg a few hours later).

I stopped taking it a couple of months ago, and quite literally, I feel "not myself" in some ways. I feel like it's hard to come up with the right words to express myself, or I feel "dumb" and feeling that way in software engineering is taking it's toll.

Can anyone relate to any of this somehow? Or am I not making any sense.

It feels like my world is crashing down and I either have to go back on Vyvanse or figure something out quick.

selftext: I hope this is allowed, because I feel like sharing this with other people who will understand!

I'm starting my diagnosis process after 4 years of various medications and therapy without an accurate diagnosis. I've had to drop off University temporarily and my psychologist suggested I go to a colleague of his to get tested. While reading about more "atypical" symptoms of ADHD (particularly in women) I've realized I most likely have it. I can't believe they are starting to realize it at 25 considering I've been to a lot of mental health professionals regarding stuff that includes my studying issues (initial motive for consult 4 years ago... different psychologist though). I'm reading a lot here about other people who weren't diagnosed as kids, and it's bizarre that it's so common! I never had issues at school so I believe it's one of the reasons it took so long.

I hope I can get properly diagnosed and start proper treatment for it! I dream of being productive. Thanks for reading!

Diagnosed with C Diff 

I posted yesterday I believe, maybe the day before when I was in the hospital. I've been diagnosed with C. Diff. The ER doc prescribed me Flagyl 500mg 3xday for 10 days. Today I took my first two pills, within about twenty minutes I had a rash all over my body that was insanely itchy, and my throat started to become restricted. 

I went back to the ER where they confirmed that yep, I'm allergic to it. They sent me home with an rx for EpiPen and a steroid to take the next few days. 

I got the C. Diff from being on a ton of antibiotics for chronic pansinusinus. Since Feb until two weeks ago I had taken: Zithromax, Cipro, Levaquin, Cefdinir and Augmentin. I'm allergic to sulfa and now flagyl. 

Any idea what my next steps should be to treat this C. Diff or to ask my doctor? I'll have to make an er follow up visit with my PCP tomorrow. Thanks again for any input.

selftext: So i was diagnosed with bipolar 2 just over 2 weeks ago. My pdoc prescribed me wellbutrin, lamotrigine and gabapentin and i thought everything was working pretty well but then i got the dreaded rash from the lamotrigine. Unfortunately, I’m on vacation in a totally different country so I can’t see my pdoc and talk to her and it’s hard to even call her (plus expensive). I stopped taking the lamotrigine 3 days ago and the rash has mostly gone away, but now i’m already becoming moody as FUCK and i hate it so much. I’ve already had suicidal thoughts as well as slightly manic feelings of overwhelming happiness. I don’t know what to do I hate this so much I just want to be neurotypical and not have to worry about hurting myself and affecting the moods of those around me.

Does anyone have any advice or things that helped you when you were first diagnosed? It would be much appreciated.

Of course, I forgot to set up my usual system of something to snack on so I don't forget to eat. So I finished working. And then I was starving. And getting too hungry is one of my anxiety triggers. And adderall is a stimulant so my anxiety got bad way fast. So now I'm lying in bed, post-xanax, trying to fall asleep so this hell will end. And I'm just so frustrated that it's so difficult for me to deal with both of these issues. I just had to get that out.

I've tried ritalin, concerta, vyvanse and adderall and can't seem to find one that works super well. Currently I'm back on adderall because it is the most beneficial.

However I really struggle (and always have) with impulsiveness, particularly in finances. I feel like I need to spend money and often do, even knowingly against my better judgement. And I pay the price for it (no pun intended).

Is this common? And how do you manage it? I'm recently divorced and living on my own again (30, M) and have always desired better control over my finances. Any tips?

My past 8 years have been really difficult for me - anorexia, constant pressure to do my best in my studies, the death of my two beloved grandparents, my father left us and doesn't care about me at all, I was diagnosed with IR and PCOS which means I might not have children at all, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. My boyfriend and I had been together for 1.5 years - just 3 hours before the breakup he had told me he loved me and just wanted me, I went to take an exam and by the time I came home, he broke up with me. He said that we shared too many different views and that I was feeling down too much. I don't understand. My mom's and my illness happened in the last 7 months and it was really hard for me to get over it and I was depressed many times. I just don't understand the whole thing. I feel like that the past time was so difficult for me, that it turned me into a person that my boyfriend didn't want. But I was just getting better and I also decided to get help from a therapist. But he said it's too late now. I'm so mad he can't stand by me and give me a second chance, to prove him, I'm really a different person, I just couldn't cope well with my problems, but I'm changing it. Please help me, I don't want to live without him. He means everything to me and I just want to get back together.

selftext: I think it’s my way of stimming, anyways. Sometimes I feel this pent up feeling inside me and release it by speaking gibberish and biting my tongue. But it usually lasts for only a few seconds and I’m generally able to not do it in public. Apart from that I used to pat myself on the head, flap my hands, blink both eyes really hard and walk up the stairs on all fours growing up. Somehow I was able to control all that quite well and aside from the blinking and flapping I don’t do any of that in public. I only realised when I was diagnosed a few months ago that these are probably forms of stimming. Can anyone relate to these forms of stimming?

selftext: I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, and attention deficit disorder. I honestly dont see the point of anything anymore. but before I go, I just want to say that I love you guys. Reading your posts makes me feel just a little less alone. So I want to do the same. We're all here because we're all going through the same things. Depression \(the disorder\) ad its treatments exist because thousands of people go through this. Yeah, I really want to kill myself. And maybe I will. But my entire life would be in vain if I didn't tell someone that I love them. That I care about them. And that I want them to stay. That we *need* y'all to stay. Anyway, love y'all.

As always, 

Stay amazing. \-Ash

I’m 24, started my period at 13 (before any diagnosis), and my moods flip LIKE CRAZY before/during my period- So this has been going on for a while. I’m on my period now and I had a bit of an episode today. Just sorta flipped out. I know that our hormones are going haywire during these times of the month. BUT as someone with BPD/GAD/PTSD/Depression, these emotional outbursts and racing thoughts feel far more intense when I’m PMSing/Menstruating. Does anyone else get this way or feel like this too? I’m curious and also wondering if it’s something I should talk to my therapist about lol

I was diagnosed with a sinus infection yesterday. I was given antibiotics (Omnicef, or the newer version, rather), and was reading up on sinus infections today. I had read that most sinus infections aren't even bacterial, but rather viral, and that got me wondering if I should be taking these antibiotics. Would these antibiotics potentially be weakening my immune system and thus doing the opposite of the intended effect, seeing as it could be viral? I'm pretty anxious about this, as a 13 year old died a couple months ago due to a sinus infection spreading to his brain. I have sinus infections every couple months but I've never had one this bad before.

However, business isn't that good and so i need to find another job. But when i start searching for jobs, thoughts keep coming to my mind like what if i'm not good enough, what if the environment is bad, or superior is bad. Thoughts like these keep me away from applying jobs. Few years ago, i was diagnosed with adjustment disorder. I have seeked help and eventually got better. But i still feel that there is this "adjustment" thing within me. Especially going to new job means going to unknown place. It just didnt feel right for me.

It is like a war in my head at times but meds for bipolar lessen the symptoms but they are still there.  When I spend too much money on special interests that is classed as a trait of Aspergers, according to a pdoc I saw a couple of years ago.  Before I took lithium I spent too much money on random and useless things.   Lithium saved me.  Yet, I was asked last week what meds I took for Asperger's.  I was a bit surprised and said there are no drugs for Asperger's, accept maybe diazepam to help with going out, say.

My doctor then prescribed me penicillin which I am now taking. I have a slight cough and I'm coughing up what looks like mucus.

I want to get an Adderall script from my doctor, but she’s not going to prescribe it if she thinks concerta is working well. Since Vyvanse and adderall are both amphetamine, does that mean adderall will probably make me a bitch just like vyvanse? Plz share personal experiences w these drugs or facts

Basically, back in February, I accidentally stumbled on some kids walking outside my window when I was unfortunately without pants. A lot of people have been saying it’s my OCD talking, that it wasn’t illegal, that the kids could have seen a lot worse all things considered.

I guess my question is, if it is OCD (and it’s a pretty big if), how do I handle this? Where do I go from here, whether it’s OCD or I actually did do something reprehensible?

I don't know if it is filtered through yet.

I've been told that I shouldnt let this diagnosis define me but when you feel and have felt like this for so long...it's comforting and alien at the same time.

I feel so much for someone.

I have made this clear to them.

They have said that they care a lot for me.
I'm at a loss as to what this means - does it mean what i feel or is it at a lesser value.

I feel like I'm ripping myself from the inside out. I'm scared and I'm terrified - i have told myself it can happen and all of this pain can go away.

But I don't understand other people. 

When I care - I give everything I possibly can.

Why does no one care about me?

My mind is telling me that doing the tests myself is supposed to do "something" and I'll know it when "it" happens. But no matter how many times I take the tests, and ruminate over how severe the symptoms could be, I can't let it go.

The problem is that my parents aren't taking this seriously. My mother keeps saying that it's all because of hormones, and it will stop when I get older. Of course, that's not true. I've always been this way and now it's just more intense because I have more work to do at school, so more things that trigger the disorder. I'm also a pretty calm person, I wouldn't call myself temperamental. So if it's not a problem for you, could you please tell me when did your OCD started? I'm getting pretty annoyed about my parents disregarding my problem.

selftext: So, this is going to be long and probably hard to follow.
A few precursory notes: I have ADHD and was diagnosed as an adult. I was diagnosed with purely obsessive OCD earlier this year.

When I was around 9 years old I had no idea I suffered from a neurological impairment. I had very little awareness of my actions and didn't understand that my behavior in class was extremely disruptive. I'd walk up, chat with my classmates and generally be a "nuisance" (actual words by a teacher of mine). I had no idea I was bothering people until I was pretty much an adult. Either way, my cognitive functioning proved sharp enough to carry me through school even if I practically never did my homework. Maybe that's why nobody bothered to even think if there's something wrong with me. After my ADHD diagnosis I followed the usual pattern that adults who get diagnosed follow and was initially in denial, thinking that I had just gone too far and invented a neuropsychiatric condition to justify my laziness. Once that passed I got so angry. Like wanting to ram my car into someone's house angry. Angry that nobody saw the obvious signs that I was not behaving normally, that I was not functioning as I was supposed to. Well, I've largely gotten over it by now. Shit happens and to be completely honest, I had no idea that I was somehow impaired either.

When I was 9 years old, I did however become acutely aware of my disorganized, forgetful nature. Countless times I'd leave school, walk up to my bike and realize I don't have a key to open the lock. I'd end up walking a long way back home, realize my bike keys are in the same keyring as my home keys and break in to my own home through the bathroom window just so I can get the damn keys and go get my bike. I broke into my own home at least a few dozen times.
 Even though I was young and had no idea what was troubling me I rationalized that if I just kept better track of where my belongings were, I'd be fine. 
This is where it all went south. In a few years I'd develop an obsessive thinking model regarding almost everything - every few minutes the thought "Check location of keys, phone and important stuff NOW" would enter my mind and I'd have to pat my pockets and make sure it's all there. It wasn't just remembering stuff, too. I would sometimes get stuck on a problem, try to solve it again, only to get stuck on the same thing as I initially did, which sort of locked me into a weird thought loop I felt unable to break free from. I failed a few tests at school due to this thought looping behavior. I'd get into a weird habit of constantly looking up things on the internet which bothered me even slightly, to look for reassurance or something I guess. It was a major hindrance for a major part of my life. I would develop weird obsessions regarding sexuality, morality, behaviour, etc.
I was diagnosed with ADHD 3 years ago and only recently did I receive a diagnosis for OCD. I've theorized that my OCD is entirely a mode of thought I've programmed myself to act upon and that by resisting these thoughts and impulses I can eventually "deprogram" myself from doing it altogether. That, coupled with the fact that I now regularly go to therapy (mainly for ADHD) has actually worked wonders.

Now that I've made it this far into writing I've largely forgotten what was the point of this long wall of text. Are there others with similar experiences? Has anyone fully healed from OCD? Does any of this even make any sense?

selftext: A few nights ago, after an argument, he confessed to me that he had lied about quite a few things in his past. I had found out before that he had lied about a few things (he claimed to have a degree when he doesn’t, he claimed he was in the military but he wasn’t), but I didn’t realise how severe it was, he also claimed to have been the victim of stabbing and shootings, claimed he worked at jobs and visited places he didn’t visit, it’s just a long list of things. He claims he can’t stop embellishing stuff and making up stories. I do believe him that he can’t stop, sometimes we will be watching a movie or something, and he starts going on these elaborate stories about his (nonexistent) time in the military, and when I call him out on it, he says he knows it’s not true, but he doesn’t know how to stop bringing up these fake stories. He’s never cheated or been deceptive to cover anything up. 

We both believe it’s a mental disorder, and we are trying to figure out the best place to start to get treatment. He’s been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, neither of which are being treated (I do know for a fact that these diagnoses are true). He also had a suicide attempt years ago, as a side effect of the anxiety medication he was on. After that happened he stopped working to treat his anxiety. 

I pressured him to see a doctor last year about it after he started becoming extremely angry over minor noises outside, and started hearing noises that weren’t there. His doctor gave him a pamphlet about a support group and that was it. He never went to the support group, and I felt she was kind of blowing him off. 

I’m not a doctor and I’m not trying to diagnose him, but his symptoms seem somewhat similar to personality disorders, like Borderline Personality Disorder (if I’m wrong please correct me). I’m under 26 and covered by my parent’s insurance, he doesn’t have insurance, he also doesn’t go to the doctors for yearly exams or anything. Are there low-cost mental health clinics that we could go to? 

My main question is, how do you even go about getting a diagnosis for mental health? And does this seem like a mental health issue? I genuinely believe he wants to get help for it but doesn’t know how to on his own.

selftext: I hope this is ok to post? To start, I must say I've never been diagnosed with BPD, but I am 22F and have bipolar disorder and several aspects of BPD strike a chord with me, particularly FPs (favorite people.) If I were to be diagnosed with BPD, it would not be very shocking, but I have never received the diagnosis as far as I know. AND I know BPD can't really be diagnosed until you're 18 but I am still wondering about this.

Through my teenage years I always thought I was really weird and was worried about how "into" certain people I got, and how much whether or not these people talked to or showed they cared for me impacted my day, for good or bad. I was dependent on them. I felt like a stalker, though I didn't have malicious intent to chase them down or scare them or anything like that. When I was a teenager, I had three main ones, two girls and a guy, one starting in 6th grade, one in 7th-ish, and one when I was about 15 until I was 20. If I reached out to them (usually through text or messaging) and they didn't reply in 5 minutes it was like a dagger through my heart, but if they replied a second later I felt an overwhelming joy. When one of them didn't talk to me for two weeks when I was 17 I went absolutely crazy, I cried the whole time and was unable to eat, knowing that I lost them forever and wishing I had them back, when really they were just busy or something... I considered two of them my friends, but in hindsight they always met a different need for me, not necessarily that of friendship. They probably thought I was extremely clingy, and one actually made it to where I couldn't see them online on Facebook, which is understandable now but I was really beyond hurt then. I think I was like 14 or 15.

What people with BPD say about their FPs really really resonated with how I've felt about these few people. I've had fixations on people since then but never people I've considered friend-like, maybe because social anxiety has made it harder to make friends as I've gotten older. I'm ambivalent towards the FP-type people I had, though I still want one of them to be my friend and we talk every couple of months.

selftext: I've had issues with zoning out in conversations forever, it's a typical ADHD symptom. I also haven't been on medication for many years as I can function quite well on a day to day basic but as i moved to another country to study I've decided to start taking medication again to assist me with university and in order to get medication I needed to be re-diagnosed.

It was pretty good. When i was initially diagnosed the conversation was always handled by my parents, I knew i had ADD or ADHD (wasn't sure exactly which one) so i got the opportunity to learn a lot of things about my condition today but since there was a lot of information i had to take in i was pretty spaced out by the end of the hour long sitting.

She was like "Take this slip STRAIGHT to the pharmacist because you're probably going to lose it and i'll write all this stuff down for you because you're giving me a blank look which i understand"

I was like, wait, she knows what this blank look on my face means...

selftext: So my friend just got out if the hospital and was diagnosed with strep (tho her papers say Tonsillitis.) Her symptoms were mainly the pain in her side and sore throat which constantly went from a dull pain to the more intense pain, along with extreme chills, fatigue, and weakness. She had no fever and wasn't too dehydrated.

I thought it'd be mono because I went thru something similar at 16, where I got diagnosed with it. So my question is, could it possibly be mono? If it is strep, how contagious is it? We've been sharing drinks and (honestly, smoking out of bongs and blunts after each other) for the oast three days (when she says her symptoms started) and I don't feel sick myself. I just wonder because my mom is disabled and I know if she got strep it'd hit her harder than most healthy people. 

She also says she gets strep often and each time was told by her doctors that they wanted to remove her tonsils, but never did. 

Shes 23, 240 lbs and 5' 9", takes no medicine, female, smokes cigs and weed, hasn't left the country any time recently.

selftext:      I want to start by saying thanks for reading this, sometimes it's good just to vent and get some shit off your chest.  I have never been diagnosed with anything or attempted to harm myself, but have dealt with depressing thoughts (more than the average person I'm guessing) since about middle school.  I know that people out there are in a much darker place than I am right now and I'm really sorry this post will come off as petty, but please realize any advice is going to be greatly appreciated.

     Long story short, I'm in my 30's and moved back with my mother once she was diagnosed with cancer.

    My parents got divorced when I was 10 and my mother was burdened with most of the heavy lifting when it came to raising 2 boys.  My father lived a couple hours away and did the whole visiting on weekends thing, but was having more fun with his new single life.  She busted ass working 2 jobs to help raise us and after we were older and moved out she continued to do so. 

     Unfortunately she wasn't keeping up with proper check ups and everything caught up around 60, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to start treatments immediately.  At the same time this happened, I had just sold my house days before and was moving away.  Being single without any responsibility or debt, I planned on doing some long overdue traveling and even turned down a promotion at the construction company I worked at to do so.

     My mother didn't give me any indication she was ill even though she knew for a couple months that something was wrong, so it came as a huge punch in the gut when she was diagnosed the day before I was leaving.  She never re-married and since I'm the oldest its on me to be more proactive with this shit and probably should have been asking more health related questions as she got older but i didn't.

     What didn't help either was that she has been renting the same house since we were little and decided to finally buy it a month before this happened.  The house is old, needs tons of improvements and is just not the ideal place for a single older lady.  I wasn't happy that she bought it but said fuck it, she's happy.

     So fast forward a couple years later and after a whole shit load of treatments and the hell that comes with it she is currently cancer free!  It is incredible news for our family and unbelievable that she was able to beat it.

     Here's where my problems come in though, I have been absolutely fucking miserable for the last 2 years.  Every day living in a town I don't like, in a house i don't like has turned me into a hateful asshole.  I love my mother and the outside I try to be pleasant, but I just can't shake the angry miserable thoughts that are always rolling around in my head.

     I have a lot of resentment towards my parents and the decisions they've made.  I don't talk to my father as much now,  maybe once every couple months.  I feel like he got to live a much better life by ditching us and now I'm paying for his selfishness again.  I always hated after they split being "the man of the family now" and having to pretty much be a surrogate husband instead of a son.  Also listening to a scorned single mother say things like "you better not treat women like this!" doesn't help.
  
    I guess I've always had this fear or a momma's boy complex that I'd be stuck living with my mother, but when it actually happened and with the timing of it all I feel like I kinda snapped.  I feel like a bigger piece of shit because my mother worked so hard to help raise us, I should be doing this without any complaints at all.  Unfortunately I can't control the thoughts in my head and from the time I wake up till I fall asleep, I'm feeling pretty shitty.  

     I think the feeling of hopelessness and not being in control of your life really does a number on you.  I feel for anyone reading this going through any kind of depression, no matter how minor or severe.  If you are in a worse place than I am, I really hope you are finding some ways to get help.  I already feel a little better just typing this out, so I guess communication is a start.

     Thanks for letting me vent, and feel free to PM if you need to do the same

selftext: I have searched the internet for any information my specific ‘cocktail’ of medications, and haven’t found anything yet. Am wondering if anyone has or is taking the same combinations and if they helped. I have battled for a few years with mental illness and have been diagnosed and prescribed endless things. I was originally diagnosed GAD, ADHD, Panic Disorder, and Depression. I was put on Ativan (only to take when having or about to have a panic attack), Pristiq 100 mg, and Biphentin. The Biphentin made me super high and I was using it recreationally, so I got switched to Adderall which made me crazy, and finally Vyvanse which I love (on 70 + 30 a day). After a couple of years of psych appointments and circumstances - I was diagnosed a year ago with Bipolar II. I was put on Lamotrigine and Abilify. As of yesterday I had my final and official diagnosis of tri-diagnosis: Bi-Polar II, Borderline Personality Disorder &amp; ADHD - the depression, panic and anxiety all being withdrawn as diagnosis’ and considered symptoms of the three primary disorders aforementioned. I have struggled for ten years (I’m 25), with addicition and reckless behaviours (etc, etc) as well as self-harming behaviours, suicidal thoughts, threats and tendencies and emotional issues. I am considered very high functioning, which is why they say it took so long to properly diagnose me. I am a full time student (4th year finance), have started my own accounting company and am the controller of a big company. Apparently because of my ability to understand social cues and adapt to situations, it was hard for Doctors to properly analyze me. But my hospital records, event triggering overreactions and upbringing were what ultimately lead them to the BPD, and my non-event triggering mood swings were what lead them to Bi-Polar II.  

Anyways, long story short (wanted to give some background), I HATED abilify - quit it cold turkey (don’t do it), because it didn’t seem to affect me and I gained weight. And as is routine with BPD, I threw the baby out with the bath water (stopped all other medication too just because I was over the side effects and I was tired of feeling like a test subject). 

I am now back fighting, and am on:

- Pristiq 150 
- Vyvanse 100
- Lamotrigine 200
- Latuda 40
- Ativan (if needed, which is like once a month)
- Melatonin (to sleep) 

Am wondering if anyone has been or is on a similar combination. If anyone has had similar experiences/diagnosis’ as me. And what people would recommend changing...

Also am wondering about the possibility of sleeping pills as I suffer from insomnia. Would anyone recommend adding them to my current cocktail, would a Doctor even prescribe? 

Thanks so much!!!!!!!!

selftext: Had I known 10 years ago today the terrible call I would get tomorrow morning, I would have come to you. I would have helped you figure it out. Instead I went on about my night while you sat alone in your sorrow with only the demons in your head to keep you company. It’s been a long ten years. I was only 22 when it took you. I was not well versed in mental illness, even though it lived beside me my whole life. I always thought it was me, that I wasn’t good enough. I didn’t know how much your mental health had deteriorated over time. I was selfish, and as teenagers and young adults do I made it about me. 
The first time I found you, when I was 17 I was broken, forever changed. I saved you, but I was so angry. It did open my eyes to the stigma, and to the lack of support that was given by medical professionals, but I always thought you just talked your way out of it, and were in denial about needing help. It was not until after your mental illness had won that I started to open my eyes. 
In 2011 I built up the courage to open your medical file and try to understand why you left. I wanted to know why you thought you were not for this world. In those records I found some things that I expected, and some that I did not. I knew that you had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder/Manic Depression in your 20’s however I never quite knew what that meant. As I read your symptoms and how you were diagnosed I started to understand that your brain did not work the same as mine. Your irritability and sometimes lack of self-regulation (mania) was not voluntary, but caused by an imbalance in your brain. 
Something I did not know is that you were diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. When I was in my late teens and early 20’s we talked about your childhood and some of the traumatic experiences that you had gone through. I have since talked to Nan about some of these experiences and through reading your medical records and conducting my own research, it became clear that these experiences were likely the reason you developed Borderline Personality Disorder. Treatment may have helped with this, but you were not diagnosed until the 2000’s.
In the 80’s there was a lot more stigma around mental health. The resources just were not there. Had doctors been more open and versed in mental health, you may have gotten proper treatment from a young age. Instead, you were left untreated for the entirety of your childhood/adolescence and most of your adult life too. I wish that wasn’t the case. 
I always thought I would never “forgive” you for “committing suicide”, but now that I am older, less ignorant and more educated, I realize there is nothing to “forgive” and you did not “commit suicide” it is simply what took your life. We don’t blame cancer patients for succumbing to disease and dying, why do we blame the mentally ill for it? The way you felt was not a choice. The pain that was in your heart was real, and it was a big part in some of the questionable choices you made during your life. These illnesses that you lived with, the demons that kept you company most of your life, played a big part in how and why you made some of the irrational decisions that you did, including the decision to end your time on this earth. 
Instead of offering forgiveness, Mom, I would like to offer an apology. I am sorry that I was too self-absorbed to understand your position. I am sorry that I was not more supportive and most of all I am sorry for not fighting harder to help you see your worth. Over the last 10 years my eyes have opened wider with each seminar, article, tv show and documentary. I have become more aware of disability due to mental illness and addiction; and, I have done my best to be more empathetic and less judgemental. I am sorry that it took me so long. 
There are so many things that I am passionate about, but this really does top the list Mom. If I could reach out to any parent or child that struggles with mental health issues, or the family that sits by feeling helpless I would. I wish that we were both more educated when there was still time. I wish that we could have figured this life out together. Despite how tumultuous our relationship was or seemed, I loved you unconditionally, I still do. I cannot change the past, but I can do my part in shaping the future. I talk about you, and the struggles you faced often. I educate people when I can, and instead of remembering your illness, I remember your vibrance, beauty and kind heart. The tears will fall, and I will never get used to you not being here. I love you and will miss you for the rest of my life. 
Love Always and Forever xoxox

selftext: I've been smoking for like 1 year and a half everyday, up to 5 times a day. I have been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and PTSD and have pretty bad anxiety, all diagnosed to me before weed use except bipolar. I can't tell if weed is starting to perpetuate my problems more than help them at the moment and I've been doing more research about the cons of regular weed use.

 My appetite sucks unless I smoke hella so i havent been eating really, I've struggled with insomnia a lot, I have pretty shitty anxiety that gives me physical symptoms like in my stomach. What ways have helped you combat those symptoms? 

Another thing is is that I love weed and appreciate it so much and I don't think I wanna give it up forever. Also my girlfriend lives with me and has been doing dabs lately and smokes and always brings home really good weed and wax.  She works at a smoke shop, too. She just came back from high times festival with some flame. Should I get hella high tonight and stop tomorrow? I mf love weed... I mean I have resisted getting addicted to everything but I definitely have a dependency on marijuana and I want to see if getting off of it will be for the better. I need to let my neurochemistry straighten out especially so I Can get a clearer diagnosis for my mental health. 

Also I have panic attacks! At times like this I could break something or hurt myself and I'm way better at coping now and getting therapy but most my family members just tell me to smoke at times like this

Plz share any insight!!

Thanks!!

selftext: Just to be clear, I've never been diagnosed with depression, I just have a lot of symptoms that seem to line up with clinical depression. I'm epileptic so I take a lot of medication to prevent seizures, I'm on a very high dosage. When I was diagnosed with epilepsy my doctors tried a variety of different drugs on me until they found a combination that worked. One things that seems to be a common denominator in the all the side effects of the medications is depression/suicidal thoughts. All of the medications caused this, some of them caused my hair to fall out so I guess what I have now is better than that. I think about suicide every day, its something that;s always in the back of my mind, a bit like Venom. A devil on my shoulder telling me the only solution to my current predicament, whether that's something as simple as being late to a lecture, is suicide. My dad had depression and PTSD from his time in the police force so I was the strong, stable male figure in my family, kinda holding things together, being a "father-figure" to my little sister, so I feel like I can't be open with my family, my friends wouldn't take it seriously. My flatmate asked me about whether I'd dealt with this kind of stuff, he could just tell apparently, and we were wasted at the time so I told him everything. He's a great guy, told me he was there to talk whenever I felt the urge, or just needed a chat, but I can't bring myself to talk about it. Since this is all caused by medication that does a lot of good for me I feel like there's no way to solve this, I feel trapped in this situation.

selftext: So I was diagnosed at 25 with adult Adhd. My depression and anxiety only started in adulthood. When I suspected I had adhd, I just tried some dexamphetamine to see what would happen.

My motivation, social skills, listening skills went through the roof and my depression, lack of confidence and social anxiety disappeared. But was I just high? Or was the medication working on my problems stemmed from adult ADHD? I've tried anti depressants for years but I still had social issues and decision making issues and had brain dog, I'm 25 and haven't done shit in my life because I have no drive or direction everything is a haze. When I have tried medication I'm a new person.


But I don't know if I'm just getting high and using the meds as a crutch.


The doctor who diagnosed me didn't want to prescribe me meds because I mentioned I had tried them without a prescription and said that was abuse and that I was just getting high?? :/ and because I did abuse weed in my earlier years (which led to social isolation) she said I'd abuse the meds. Honestly, I would take the dose prescribed and only use it when I need to.

I'm a fucking zombie unmedicated, I do the stupidest shit at work (when I'm actually employed because I change jobs so often)because when someone is instructing me to do something I cant help but listen to the song playing in the background. I avoid anything social but when on meds I actually want to socialize.


Is medication for me? Or am I just getting high. I know you're not doctors but would love to hear from anyone with a similar experience if you're out there.

selftext: I have been diagnosed with GAD comorbid with panic disorder. The last few years i have been living in anxiety. And everytime i got anxious i get so scared of the anxiety going out of control that i obsess about the feeling and focus on it constantly. Which obviously will result in anxiety getting worse or panic attacks. Well from today on im done with living in fear of my anxiety. I just am an anxious person and thats fine, i dont need to be scared of more anxiety when i feel anxious. Its a lot easier to just go with the flow, and let yourself feel anxious. Its an emotion and its normal. It will pass. From now on im going to accept it when im anxious.

My wife is very nervous and scared that I was perscribed Adderall for fear of my addictive personality and the intensity of Adderall. She is afraid I am going to be a twitchy mess but my first day on my medication was the greatest I have felt in a long time. 

How have you experienced this and what were you able to do to relieve the fears of your loved ones? 

I have told her that if it becomes an issue within the first couple weeks I will contact the doctor for another medication but her response was I will feel so good that I won't want to leave it. I am not sure what to do 😓

My urine has also been a darker yellow even though i've been drinking a good amount of fluid.

I've been reading up on Amoxicllin side effects and this all lines up with it. Should I head to the hospital, or simply stop taking the Amoxicillin maybe? I was instructed to take two 500mg tablets three times daily, and the final day for that cycle is tomorrow.

I’ve dealt with bouts of low mood ever since I was diagnosed with GAD, but recently I haven’t really been affected by my anxiety (bar derealisation) but instead a lack of motivation, laziness and lethargy has taken its place for a while now. 

I had hoped once I’d learnt to control my anxiety life would be cool, considering what I’d overcome but I just seem to be feeling flat more often that not. 

Any advice or thoughts on the matter would be great, I feel like this is harder to work through than the panic attacks, irrational thoughts etc or just to know it’s part of GAD or something haha..

* Diagnosed with ADHD in 5th grade and been on a high dosage of stimulants every since.

* Have the tendency to bounce from relationship to relationship with heavy Tinder involvement in between them.

Anyway, I noticed that for the longest time I tended to get very invested in apps like Tinder (still do) when I'm not in a relationship. Ever since discovering this sub (which has changed my life) I've been on a bit of a journey of self-discovery and part of that journey is questioning why I do things that seem to stray from the cultural norm. So my question to you all is, do you get extremely invested in dating apps as well? If you don't, is there anything you do get extremely invested in?

**TL;DR: I get very invested in Tinder, sound like you?**

Yes I understand a lot of people have ADHD and there are different kinds and severity but it’s still a disorder and a medical condition that can only be diagnosed by a medical condition. Don’t get me wrong, before I was tested I thought I had ADHD but I went to be tested to find out what the hell is wrong with me. 
But imagine a normal person who tells you, with severed ADHD to the point of you can’t function at your job or school without medication and life style changes “come on, just focus we are all ADD sometimes”

I was told by my doc to give it 3 months at 70mg (highest dose) and then report back, but just wanted to see how others got on with the process and whether you found the right medication/dose early or if it took a while.

The only thing it seems to help with is actually making me feel motivated to start things but now I'm just left with dozens of projects I've started and don't have the motivation to finish! My reading, memory, concentration/focus, are all just as bad as they were before and they only seem to work the way I imagine maybe 2 days a week.

selftext: I, 31/F, have been experiencing a pain in my upper left abdomen and underboob area for almost a year. I've had an endoscopy, CT scans and a nuclear CT scan done. The only diagnose that I have been given is hiatal hernia, chronic inflammation, anxiety and they found a small nodule on my lower left lung, which they said is most likely benign. It's been slowly increasing in the level of discomfort and pain. I cannot lift or pull anything without addition sharp pulsed of pain. At this point, my doctors are stumped and cannot find a cause. Today my PCP suggested acupuncture. I am not opposed to it, but I don't feel like this will resolve the issue. 
If you have any suggestions or advice...i would greatly appreciate it. I'm at my wits end.

selftext: My boyfriend has been struggling with body image issues and has restricted eating often. We were invited to a trip to the beach with our friends but he doesn't want to go because of his insecurities, so it is literally stopping him from doing something he wants to do. He is not diagnosed with an eating disorder but I'm scared he might have one. I've talked to him about it and he agreed he should get help, but neither of us knows how to. He doesn't want to talk to his parents about it and we just graduated, so he doesn't have access to a counselor. The only thing I can think of is waiting until he goes to college this fall and talking to that counselor, but I really want him to get help as soon as possible.

But I have a secret, I am suffering. I am not diagnosed out of fear of getting kicked out, but I hit every wicket for Borderline Personality Disorder. I don't know what to do; if I am honest about my home life, I will be kicked out. I come from a poor family, who make my mental health worse, so I have no where to go when I get out. I don't know what to do. I have no friends, my family barely talks to me. I am lost. 

Is there going to be any end to my struggle? Any one else navigate the military with mental health? I don't know how much longer I can do this.

selftext: I don't know if I should tell my friend(s) about going through the diagnostic process for possible ADHD? I feel like I want to talk to somebody about it but I'm also scared how will they react. What if they don't take me seriously? What if it turns out that I don't have ADHD but I'm just a lazy piece of sh*t looking for excuses or something? 

I had kind of decided not to tell anyone until I know what is going on. But then my friend suddenly started talking about some ADHD stuff and it was such a weird and awkward conversation because I didn't know how to talk about it neutrally and was just thinking if I should tell or not.

Did you or would you tell? How did your friends take it? What if I end up not being diagnosed? Other advice?

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD a little over a year ago at 30.  I’ve been on Adderall XR since then and am having great results.  I feel like a new man.  I’m succeeding at work and achieving great things in my personal life.

There is one thing I’m continuing to battle with on a regular basis, and that’s my past trauma.  I struggled mightily through high school and college, as I’m sure most of you did or are.  I failed at a lot of things, despite being blessed with what most teachers and professors described as “incredible potential”.

Occasionally thoughts of what I could have been will prove overwhelming.  I’m planning to see a therapist about this but I also wanted to see if this community had any advice re: letting go of past failures and disappointments.

selftext: Hey guys I’ll try to make it quick and brief.

So... I’m in a situation right now and I feel stuck. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, OCD, Tourette’s (physical ticks,) anxiety, depression, PTSD, trauma, insomnia, some symptoms of schizophrenia, and signs and symptoms of BPD. *There’s literally more I just can’t think of it.* I listed my diagnosis because I was told by my dads girlfriend that “nothing has ever been hard in my life.” She is literally the most abusive trash that I have ever known. She brainwashed my dad to kick me out of his house because I was being lazy and disrespectful for staying in my room when I was SUICIDAL and DEPRESSED. Does this bitch have the slightest knowledge about mental health?? Apparently not. I am bipolar so every year is a hard one because I become manic every year. It also seems to be around the time where I have my life together then I’ll lose it all. I try and try sometimes even breathing is hard. So for that disgusting scum to tell ME that things haven’t been hard is such a big “Fuck you” to me. I’ve told my dad in the past about how I feel only to get shut down by him. He either says, “you’re just manic,” to “you’re not suicidal, your just trying to manipulate me and your mother.” And I can’t begin to tell you how heartbreaking that is to hear from a parent you’ve trusted your whole life. My dad dates abusive scum bags and will ALWAYS stick up for them no matter what. I have some semi proof of how she acts on video. But I don’t want to post it because I am in the process of obtaining more information currently. She will hit my dad SO HARD I can either hear it across the whole house, in the shower with the water running, or even two rooms down with music blasting. She gives woman a bad rep. She’s a disgusting human being and I’m going to make sure that petty bitch gets a ticket to jail. I feel physically ill over everything that has happened. If you know me personally you would recall the time when I was a very outgoing, smart, funny beautiful woman. Now I look really gross and no one will even look at me. You wouldn’t recognize me tbh. If I’m with my best friend and someone is talking to them, I’ll say hi and that person will not even acknowledge my existence.

Edit: sorry if that went off topic I’m just not going through a good time right now... 😅

selftext: 3 years ago I was originally diagnosed with Bipolar type 1. I was 18. 
In the last 6 or so months I felt that my diagnosis wasn't very fitting, I started getting hallucinations, paranoia, delusions randomly, and I wasn't "manic" at the time. 

So I went to see my psychiatrist and said I think I have schizophrenia. After a few sessions with him telling him when the symptoms all started he agreed with my idea of a different diagnosis.

Lately it's been hard for me, friends and family don't understand how schizophrenia affects me and don't usually know how to respond when I start talking about my delusions and hallucinations. It's hard because I often feel attacked and misunderstood.

I keep having these images placed into my mind and voices telling me to do things and say things and they're constantly chatting to themselves and sometimes arguing with my own inner voice.

I see shadow people, things crawling over all the walls in my house, things I'm looking at start warping and distorting. 

I constantly feel like I'm about to snap and fully lose touch with reality and it's so hard to work out what's happening and what's not.

I could say so much more about what it's like for me but I'll keep it short and sweet.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

selftext: I have been recently diagnosed by my psychology with ADD (non hyperactive) after feeling like I’ve had it my whole life. I am so glad I have a diagnoses and everything finally so I can get treatment and not feel insecure every second bc I can’t follow directions. 

I’ve done numerous alternative therapies including brain stimulation, brain core, diet change, tons of cognitive behavioral therapy, supplements, &amp; more.  My psychiatrist decided to put me straight on medicine since I explained all of the things I’ve tried to help with my focus issues in the past. She has prescribed me a few different medications over the last couple months and I’ve tried Ritalin, Concerta, &amp; Adderall. Ritalin made me have panic attacks, and concerta did too but also caused the worst headache in my life. Adderall made me super irritable. None of these drugs helped my focus at all no matter the dose.

My psychiatrist is starting me on a new one now called Contempla and I really haven’t been able to find any info about it online. I’m starting it tomorrow morning, though! If anyone who has had negative experience with typical ADD drugs has had any experiences with Contempla that they’d like to share that’d be great 😊

Hello, I was diagnosed with OCD by a psychiatrist 2 years ago. He prescribed clomipramine, clonazepam and risperidone. These two years have been very good, I started feeling bettee, I got a girlfriend etc..

But recently I had to go through a very hard break up as my SO left me, she said she needs time, so on and so on.. But since the breakup, I feel like my OCD is kind of back, not as worse, but still very unpleasant at times. As I do not have the oppurtunity to make an appointment with my psychiatrist for the next few weeks (living in different cities) I have decided to increase my Anafranil. I am currently taking 175 mg and would really appreciate an advice from someone in this field. I have exams coming, I'm starting work in a few days and can't afford to have OCD holding me back. :(

All input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

selftext: TLDR; I just got diagnosed today and was prescribed with Wellbutrin 150mg. 

Went to see a mental health practitioner today. I talked about how I was not a good student in high school, how I skipped school numerous times because I could not focus in classes, struggled to read long pages of books, etc. 

The symptoms have been killing me inside during my past 8+ years of high school + college education. Now it was hurting my job performance and career and I could not resist anymore but seek out for help.

My mental health practitioner wanted me to start with a non-stimulant drug first and see how it goes for a month. Got Wellbutrin 150mg and will be taking them starting tommorow! 

I was quite surprised that she diagnosed me in just under a 1 hour of talking about my past life, struggles, etc. But I was relieved that there is actually a problem with my mental health and I could now work on treating it. 

Anyways, is there anything I should watch out for while on Wellbutrin ?

selftext: I was diagnosed about 6 months ago and I’m very aware of the fact that I just need vyvanse. I need something that wakes me up and encourages me to fight through the constant fog and confusion that follows me around. But I hate when I can feel it waking me up - I just want to be sleepy and comfortable. I hate when it keeps me aware of time passing, or the things I need to do - I feel like my skin is crawling. All I want to do is lie around in my ADHD haze, though I know what a hell that can turn into, and I know how much better my quality of life is when I take medication every day. But I hate it. I don’t understand how people take this recreationally.

I've also been on frequent checkups with my eye doctor for potential glaucoma. I haven't been diagnosed, but my dad has lost most of his sight from glaucoma, and my eye doctor has noticed "flakiness" and increased pressure in my eyes recently. After meeting with my doctor and eye doctor I recently came off Sertraline, and my depression and anxiety have worsened to about what I remember it being before starting medication, and so now I'm wondering if there's any alternative medications out there that could help but without potential side affects that might interfere with my sight. I plan on seeing my own doctor but any advice is appreciated, thank you!

selftext: I was diagnosed about 4 years ago, but due to their cultural background my parents think ADHD isn’t “real”. Because of this we compromised by agreeing to only take Vyvanse on days I have to go to class/take a test.

On days I take Vyvanse I actually get stuff done. On days I don’t though, it’s not just that I get distracted easily and I’m not focused, I’m straight up NOT motivated to do anything. At all. It’s a little bit scary how much I just don’t care. In my head I know I have to get something done, otherwise I won’t make the deadline and I’ll fail but that fear is just nonexistent when I’m not on meds. Is this normal?? Will this mean I have to take meds for the rest of my life??

I really have been in struggle what's wrong with me if i can say like that because nothing was wrong until i was diagnosed and realised that i have that ADHD thing (so called). Did you also have that relief or feeling after you found out the answer of all the things have been going through entire your life were that, because we tend to think and behave a little bit different. But kind of i feel special for ADHD.

Here you can also read my full story about my ADHD at About us section. [Click here to read my full story!](https://supremebrains.com/)

selftext: I have called numerous psychologists and psychiatrists so I can be diagnosed with ADHD. Psychologists are much cheaper (lowest I found around $250 for two appointments) while Psychiatrists run usually over $1000 and take two long appointments (15ish hours total).  Psychologists can't write prescriptions but can they and do they readily refer your diagnosis to your family doctor to be medically prescribed?

I would rather go the cheaper and faster route. I truly can go without 15 hours of testing with imo unnecessary elements of iq testing, etc done by psychiatrists. Will the psychologist not give me a hard time referring a prescription to my family doctor? What are your experiences concering this? I hate to have my psychologist say you don't need meds you need behavioral therapy to solve ADHD which is a bunch of hogwash. Thanks!

I have been diagnosed with depression, but it seems to come and go randomly. Like I don’t enjoy feeling sad, but whenever the sadness goes away and I’m actually happy I seem to try to find ways to bring me down on purpose. It’s like I’m not satisfied with just happiness and I’m addicted to having problems. Like without problems something feels like it’s missing. I hate feeling depressed, but I love it at the same time, it’s like I’m so used to being sad all the time that it’s just not me to be happy.

I'm very high functioning (most people don't realize I have Asperger's unless they both know me personally and have a solid understanding of the disease) and as far back as I remember, I've used masking as my primary form of coping. 

Personally, I've never disliked people, I've never dismissed social rules or non-verbal communication as bullshit. I've come to believe I just never learned those rules and have made a continual effort to try and adjust myself.

I find it extremely frustrating that overwhelming majority of (scientific/medical) literature about autism and Asperger's seems to be for people *around* those with the condition, rather than those *with* the condition itself.

Does anyone else feel this way? Any recommendations for literature on adjusting into society?

I had to take medicine like lexipro Adderall, and others for a lot of my childhood. I honestly thought I couldn't function without it. Then one day I stopped taking it, and realized I was fine. I am a functioning member of society, and I really want to join the airforce after college to open more opportunities, but I obviously cannot do this with autism under my medical records. Is there anything I can do? I am honestly a regular kid who functions normally, and I do not believe I have autism.

For the first weeks I had to take Medikinet Retard 10mg and for the first time in my life i had to feel an "inner peace", concentration etc y'all know that :D
Since a week i should take 20mg but it's like I didn't take anything, still got all my symptoms and this "pressure" in my chest. The most confusing point is, that I can't even feel the rebound when the meds wear off.
I tried the 10mg again and it's all OK and I can feel the rebound when its wearing off. 
Is this an overdose with the 20mg or how is that possible? 
No effects, side effects, rebound or anything..

Chronic pain is something I deal with and it only exacerbates my ADHD. I don’t currently take anything for either condition. I was reading about dopamine deficiency in ADHD patients and was wondering if stimulant medications which give the body dopamine would help with pain. A quick google search showed plenty of results. I’m wondering if any of you have experienced this. If any of you deal with chronic pain but find that it’s made better with stimulant medications and nothing else, no type of pain killing drugs. I’m really curious to see what you guys have to say. Thank you!

Which i can agree with . And ive never understood why i am like this. Ive been through hell and back no doubt. But some days i wake up and feel absolutely nothing. Then days like today i wake up in tears for no reason. Ive cried all day today and slept. I dont know why. It hurts so bad though and i dont know what to do to make it better.

selftext: I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder,PTSD and I have health/death anxiety as well as panic attacks. 
I was doing so well at managing it until I became a caregiver for my mom who passed away earlier this year. 
Her death set me back into a horrible downward spiral which I'm slowly managing to get out of. 
It's just really hard when every time I step out my front door I think I'm going to die in a car accident or get injured in someway. 

I know I need to take the first step and see a doctor but the last one I saw made me feel judged and like I was wasting her time because it wasn't anything physically wrong. 

I'm just anxious about everything and I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

selftext: I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder for a few years but recently that disagnosis has gone away in favor of just bipolar disorder. In any case, I'm still stuck on the idea of being schizophrenic because my social life is extremely limited and in need of a lot of help. Social dysfunction is a condition or symptom of being schizophrenic so I was wondering how other schizophrenic people coped with their social dysfunction, or what their social lives are like. Or even what they do to help themselves in these situations. I personally am said to be somewhat functional when it comes to socializing, but I still have a hard time, and I like going to meet up.com meet ups sometimes, but I still feel I need things like social skills training classes and cognitive remediation therapy.

I have tried several sleep aids and I will list them below and why they haven't worked for me. I'm hoping someone has some suggestions for sleep aids that I can request from my doctor.  

Here's what I've tried so far:
Ambien - Worked perfectly, but gives me bad tinnitus
Lunesta - Puts me to sleep, but doesn't keep me asleep
Doxepin - Worked for sleep, but makes me super drowsy and depressed the next day
Seroquel - Same effects as Doxepin
Trazodone - Makes me a little drowsy, but doesn't help me fall asleep or stay asleep
Zaleplon - Helps me fall asleep for a couple of hours, then I wake up with a panic attack

selftext: Two years ago I was diagnosed as mildly lactose intolerant from a poop-collection test that I wouldn't recommend to anyone to do for fun. I was apparently lactose intolerant my whole life without realizing. When the norm is being fucked up, you don't realize how bad you have it. 

I thought solving that would cure what we figured was the cause of my warm marshmallow poops. I'm thinking now that there's something else causing me to have issues. I can completely avoid dairy and still end up with four days of diahrea like I have right now. Or weeks at a time of poops that take 30 minutes to get out, and another 30 minutes to appropriately clean. This has lead to severe discomfort for one, and almost a phobia behind making a bowel movement in any bathroom but my own, which is immediately followed by a shower usually. When you look at those graphs that describe a healthy poo, mine aren't really on it..

I don't really have stomach issues otherwise. The lactose intolerance solved the gut I carried with me all my life, and lead me to lose 70lbs and become much healthier in general. The issue is strictly my doodie, as far as I can tell. 

I've been told I don't have Crones disease, but not because I was tested in any way, the doctor I saw about being lactose intolerant said what I had didn't really match up.

I know you guys can't diagnose me for anything with such limited information, but I'm hoping you guys can point me in the right direction with who can help me solve this. 

Do I go to the hospital, do I visit a walk in clinic, do I make an appointment with my family doctor, do I go straight to the stomach doctor? Or is there a bowel doctor I need to see? Insurance isn't an issue for me, I'm from British Columbia, Canada. 

Thank you.

selftext: Hello,

So few years ago my dad had a severe health issue and was diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome. He almost died at the time, his muscles became very weak but he did it and it went away after two months of bed time. With a lot of physiotherapy his muscles came back but not as before, but he was pretty healthy... until one month ago when the symptons started again, but less severe.

The symptons now are what i point on the title of this post. We have good financial conditions and my dad is a doctor himself, he visited many many doctors already including two neuros. He also made lots of exams and EVERYTHING CAME BACK OK, everything (physically) is normal, but his leg muscles keep getting thinner and weaker. 

Also, he has some anxiety and his muscles shakes, not like spasms, but they shake a little bit and NO DOCTOR IS ABLE TO DIAGNOSE WHAT HE HAS. One thing we discovered, it is not Guillain–Barré syndrome and most probably the first time was not it as well.

The reason I'm posting here is because maybe, just maybe, even if 1% possibility of someone knowing something or giving us a hint as to what this could be. All exams ok, blood, brain, all seem just normal, however, he's feeling all those symptoms for almost two months now. Somedays he is 95% better, all good, some days he is feeling all the synptons again. When we think its getting better and going away it comes back just to go away next day.

One thing is fore sure, his legs are getting weaker and weaker, to the point of not being able to walk 100 meters or to walk a steep sidewalk for 20 meters.

Has anyone ever seen this before?! I would appreciate ANY information that could point us to the right direction. Please upvote for visibility, this is one of our last resources!

selftext: I have never been tested or diagnosed with anything, just depression I think is what I have.

When I was  a young kid, I was raised pretty much completely by a neighborhood women who my family paid. My dad was never there for me and my sisters, and my mom was always away in south america for her work. This lady died, and while my mom cried for a few days, my sisters felt sad about it. I cried almost every day for a year after. Still today, the thought of her when im in a mood makes me cry and feel depressed. Every few days or about once a week, I have these episodes where I get super depressed, suicidal, and paranoid of everything around me.

The common things I think about is how I will never amount to anything, or that every friend or even family member around me is just being paid to act like they enjoy my company or that I have something like autism affecting me. Even when I have these episodes, I know I am not being rational, but I just cant help but feel those things. I don't really know how to deal with this anymore. Every time I go through it, in my head I give myself two options, runaway or suicide. I know I will probaby never do any of the two, I am too much of a chicken to actually commit to running away and it would not solve anything, and I also always think about all the commitments I have and how it would hurt my family if I killed myself.

I am pretty sure I have ADD, I have super bad issues concentrating and have times where I frequently zone out. My mom always denies that I could have anything like it, since to her I am just not concentrating hard enough funnily enough. Which makes it harder for me to think I could have a disorder such as Schizophrenia. I relate with many of the symptoms, but I never experience those hallucinations, or voices in my head. If I ever even brought it up with my family or our family doctor I know I would be dismissed.

Sorry for this wall of text, I'l add a few indents to make it look extra neat. thanks

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI yesterday after weeks of doctors visits, and I was so so nervous to start my meds today. Terrified that they wouldn’t work for me, that I would feel even worse, that after yesterday’s relief at being diagnosed it would all come crashing down.

Boy, was I wrong.

I took three-quarters of a 15mg pill at 1pm, and by 1:10 I knew something was different. There’s a great post on this thread from earlier today that describes the mental quiet that occurs with meds, and that’s exactly what it was like for me, though I didn’t have the words to describe it then. All I knew was that it was quieter and it honestly made me a little worried.

Being a junior in high school, I have a shit ton of homework every weekend and it often doesn’t get done only because I can’t focus on any one assignment. My grades are tanking because of it, especially in my honors physics class, where I’m struggling to raise my C. After I took my pill, I started with my physics homework to see if Adderall really worked for me.

I finished one problem and burst into tears.

Where it would usually take me twenty minutes to finish one problem, with Adderall it took me five. For the first time in over a year, I could finish an assignment on time, in a timely manner, and with ease. I could look at a problem and figure out what I needed to do to solve it, without having to tell my own mind to shut the hell up. I had run out of hope, I was so tired, I was ready to give up on school and life and my future until I did my homework today.

In five hours, I was able to finish every homework assignment from my past two school days. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but that is amazing for me. I now have so so much hope for my future that wasn’t there before. I’m sorry that this is so long, but I’m just so excited! I never thought a diagnosis and a pill could help me so much.

Thanks to everyone on this thread for sharing their experiences and helping me know I’m not alone in my ADHD struggles. Also thank you for listening to this story thing ❤️

selftext: I've always had problems with relationships, friends family and loved ones. And I've always thought, wow I have really bad luck. Because I know people who are way worse than me, people who are sexist and rude and have anger issues and violent streaks, who have way more friends. So either I'm literally the worst human being on the face of the earth, or I'm just meeting shi*ty people. All the time. I've spent a long time trying to convince myself it was the latter, even though I've always believed it was just because I'm garbage and unlovable. Once I was diagnosed with BPD, it felt like my suspicions were just being confirmed. It felt to me like I was having a medical professional tell me "no, no you're right, this is all your fault, you just drive people away because you're unlovable and impossible to deal with." This feels really awful, and it's also made me so suspicious of whenever I have ANY sort of negative emotions. If my housemate is being snarky to me and making rude comments, I feel like I no longer have a right to be upset with them, because they did nothing wrong its just me and my disorder making it up. If my girlfriend ignores my texts for an entire day and I feel kind of ignored or unimportant, I feel like I no longer have a right to have those feelings - this isn't her fault, its my fault for being so desperately clingy that I expect to talk to my s/o more than once a day. Ever since this diagnosis I just feel like I don't trust anything I feel - everyone else is perfect and any time someone seems like they are being mean, or disrespectful, or hurtful, its actually my fault - I did something to them, its not that big of a deal, or I'm just making it up. Has anyone else here struggled with these feelings of self-blame, especially after the diagnosis? Am I crazy? Am I right? Is this all my fault? If it is what do I do, just live my life knowing I'm garbage and the cause of all the ills in my life? And if its not, how am I supposed to trust my own thoughts knowing I've been diagnosed with a disorder that was described to me as basically medical jargon for "everything you feel is excessive and ridiculous"? I'm feeling super lost and hopeless right at this particular moment.

selftext: Sorry if this is long, it’s been a very rough few days.

My fiancé and I are in our early twenties. We are due for our first child, in August. He is my everything, and he is such an amazing and beautiful person. But he is very emotionally and mentally unwell.

He has struggled with mental illness (he has a diagnoses of Bipolar 2) our whole relationship, but it’s always been somewhat manageable. He’s always been strongly against getting any form of help. He was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 when he was in seventh grade, and due to a bad experience with a shitty therapist, he never got help.

Things have been gradually getting worse over the years, and the last six months or so it has just been climaxing... and it finally came to a head last week. I was forced to do the most difficult thing I have ever done, and give him an ultimatum—get help, or leave.

After some time, he has decided he can not leave me or his daughter, and wants to do anything and everything to get well. I am comforted to hear that he isn’t just doing it for us, but also for himself—as I know that’s what matters. He *wants* to get better.

Long, probably unnecessary, background aside.

He is going to go start making appointments, and taking the first big scary steps this week.

I want to support him in every and any way I can. I don’t have any insight with Bipolar, as I just have depression.

When you were first starting to accept help, and taking the awful first steps, was there anything you wish someone had done, or said? Is there anything I can say to ensure he knows I am here for him? And what can I do to keep him encouraged—as I know how discouraging and hard the first several months can be?

I hope this is the right place to ask, and that I don’t sound ignorant. I would just do anything to help him, and I want to make sure I am supporting him the best way I can. Thank you so much for any insight or advice.

TL;DR: My fiancé is about to start getting mental help for his past diagnosis of Bipolar 2 disorder. How can I best support and help him?

selftext: So a bit of a long story but, I started CC about two years ago. I completed most of a certificate, got some more outside certificates and got a decent job. I worked sixty hour weeks and tried to finish the 16 credit load at the same time. I was going to drop the term but just... didn't. I didn't know how really and I was naive enough to think explaining my situation would fix everything when I wanted to go back to school. During the certificate I maintained a 3.6 GPA, and completed 48 credits.

About half a year after this when work slowed down a bit, I enrolled in two classes to get started on an associates. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with cancer shortly after the term started so I dropped it.

When I tried to go back this term, they told me that I needed an academic appeal as those two terms had dropped my GPA below a 2.0. Now the term where I just didn't know what the fuck I was doing is understandable, but I figured dropping a term due to being seriously ill wouldn't put it on my record.

I attempted school again this term and encountered a new issue. I had some serious mental issues and was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD. My school gave me an accommodation from this previous week onward \(second to last week of term\) but the damage has been done and my teachers seem unwilling to allow me to attempt to submit everything this week. Fair enough, I guess.

Anyways suffice to say, I bombed this term really, really badly. It just wasn't even a concern for me as I was sort of having a daily mental breakdown that preoccupied me. I really don't like this school for other reasons \(namely the staff is rather rude and unhelpful\) so I don't intend to go back here. 

I am determined to try school again when I am in a better place. My therapist and I are working very hard to get me there, and I will be there eventually. But what can I do? I have ordered my transcripts but I know this will look really bad. Will I be able to try again at another school in a few months time? I was going to complete some CLEPs in the interim so I build up good study habits, but will that look good?

So today I felt a little pain in my ankle and took 2 200mg ibuprofen around noon. I then proceeded to sip a cup of coffee over a period of... I wanna say the past 5-6 hours. I've heard taking caffeine and ibuprofen together leads to mixed results... Is it bad that I took the two together 7-8 hours apart? The coffee had 1 packet of sugar inside of it. I'm asking because I feel no pain in my ankle (good) but feel minor neck strain (which could be just from working at a computer or a problem). I have shown symptoms of but have not been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, have B12 deficiency, and have been feeling (as far as I'm aware) an unrelated dull pain in the back of my left eye on and off today.

I am not diagnosed with anything, but sometimes I start feeling like everything I do is wrong, and I hate myself so much that I "punish" myself by banging my head against things or whipping myself w a cord or cable. Then I start hating myself for the destructive outburst, and feel like I worry the people around me. It becomes a cycle that fuels itself.

This brings me to a concern with my kitten. I have these extreme outbursts maybe once every month or every other month, and I'm afraid to be causing a bad environment for my kitten to grow up in. I feel horrible about it, but idk what to do. What do you guys think? Is it wrong to raise a cat in this kind of environment? Anyone have any similar experience?

I feel my body being sucked off of the ground and it causes me very intense anxiety. Now what makes this even stranger is that I know that, due to the physics of a black hole, there wouldn't be a reverse of gravity and we wouldn't get sucked in; we would simply orbit the black hole. 

I think I have disassociation disorder because I have almost no feeling in my legs, and this never changes even when I'm sober \-\- which I am most of the time besides my occasional weed use. It feels like I'm floating and it makes my anxiety so much worse because despite evidence to the contrary I fear a black hole causing me to fall into the sky.

I have not gone to therapy as I find it next to impossible to find any therapy in the town I am in as it is small. There was a Mindfulness Movement Therapy Group that had about a 6 month wait list but it just wasn’t my thing. What do you guys do to cope? I have been feeling very empty, and sad. When I get like this I have the urge to hurt myself. I never end up doing it because I try to remind myself mind over matter, but I’m scared one day I’ll become to sad and I’ll want to hurt myself.

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD around August of 2017. It was kind of weird to me because I had come to my psychologist for antidepressants. I wasn't referred by anybody but it was just something I knew. Too many years of feeling depressed. * He only gave me some antidepressants several months later though that's not a story for this subreddit*

When my psychologist told me I had ADHD, it didnt seem right. He said my anxiety was just a symptom of it. So being on medication for a few months, I learned that my tendencies to overthink are ADHD induced. The pieces fell into place. Why I had a hard time concentrating when reading or listening to someone, even if I tried really hard to. Why I always switched between watching TV and doing my homework when I was younger. Why I either blank out or overthink. It was ADHD.

What about you guys?

At some point, when I fell in love I thought I'm really happy and that depression, self harm and other things won't come back.
Now we are arguing, he misunderstood a thing and now he says to me that he doesnt know if he still loves me.
He said he feels chained to me because he knows that if he will break with my I will commit suicide. That's true, yeah. Because he's the only thing I care about and that can make me happy.
But the fact is that I want he's real love, not the fear that he could be responsable of my death.
I'm crying all the time. I don't want to be this way, I want to be happy.
I don't want to die but at the same time I think I don't have other choices.

Okay, I was diagnosed with depression when I was thirteen, and I would tell the psychologist a lot when he would ask me how my meds were working, but something I was always too scared to tell was that I constantly thought about (and still do) was that I often fantasize about my death, and what people would do. Something about the thought of feeling missed, and having all those posts about me, and people talking about me gives me satisfaction to daydream about. Before I go to sleep I always like to daydream about things I want to happen and this is often what I fantasize about. It makes me feel like I’m very fcked up in the head for even enjoying people being so torn that I’m gone, is this normal for depression or am I an awful person...?

I don't have BPD myself, but someone I care deeply for is diagnosed with it, and it's become overbearing to the point for her where she is looking to get away from everything and admit to inpatient care. I have a found a few places in our vicinity that I want to call and get the gist of, but I'm not sure what types of questions I should be asking. Can you share the types of questions you would ask a facility or hospital about their inpatient programs? I'm just a bit worried because I have heard some of the horror stories that go on in these places.

Thank you all! And to everyone dealing with BPD, you're not a bother, you're not unloved, and you're not crazy. You're dealing with a mental issue that many people can't or choose not to understand. But there are people out there who do understand and will accept you for it. Don't give up! =\)

I've since moved and have seen a few psychiatrists trying to find the right fit. Each one when I've brought up Adderall (it's what worked for me) will immediately shut down. Like we were having a good, normal back and forth and then I mention I'm seeking medication for my ADHD and it's just 'hmmm'. 

Thing is, I've been unmedicated for a while now and my QoL is suffering. My grades are suffering. I've tried meditation and mindfulness but that can only help so much. So what am I doing wrong? Is there a way to make it clear I'm not just a pill chaser? I offered to retake the test and my psych literally said no, because some people cheat it. Like wtf how can I prove this?

Followed by 36mg assuming no side affects after a week and finally 54mg a week after that. As you know it's a trial and error process so my doctor told me to record everything that I feel and experience so we can hone in on the specific drug and dose that works for me.

I've never taken any sort of prescription drug before and I was wondering what you people have experienced and what I should be looking out for. Really any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR:Got put on Concetra as my first medication and would like to know what I should be looking out for as both good and bad signs, thanks in advance.

I'm working a contract gig (first real job in 14 months) right now.  Currently in therapy for myself and in marriage counseling too

Twice in 4 days, I've lost my shit with my husband - yelling, crying, acting irrationally.  Once was because I had a bad day at work, got 2 rejection letters for other jobs and he wasn't being as kind to be as I wanted/needed.  The other was last night when we were on completely different pages re: sex.

I just don't know how to regulate my emotions when I'm upset.  This is my weakest skill.  How do you improve on this?

selftext: I am new to reddit and was diagnosed with ADHD in 2005. As I got older, I feel like my ADHD has gotten worse. I’m on a medication that works well for me right now. I am the only one I know personally who has ADHD at my college and I struggle to feel a part of it all. I struggle a lot with getting to class because of self doubt and anxiety. My grades suffer because of it. My boyfriend tells me to not be hard on myself because I have to work twice as hard as normal students. This subreddit has been such a blessing. There are so many people who share stories that connect to me and it makes me really emotional. So basically I’m glad that I have a place where I can come for help with my ADHD this next year. (I’m going into my senior year of college and I’m trying to reach a 3.0 GPA)

selftext: I'm 21 and I've been diagnosed for all of my life. I've never had any friends because I never picked up social skills when I was a kid, I've never been in a job because I've low level of qualifications, I've been unemployed on benefit for two years and it's looking like I'll never get off it. 

I don't know if it's a common thing for people with ADHD to feel isolated or ostracized, I know that I was never someone people wanted to be friends with because of being the "weirdo" or "creep". I would love to hang out or talk with friends, I'd love to work and come home and not feel guilty, I'd love to actually date. Unfortunately with the way ADHD is for me it's incredibly difficult to do any of those. 

Sorry that my post is a bit rambly, I feel all over the place and I've no-one to talk to so this is the alternative.

selftext: 24, f, 5'6", 145 lbs. US. Heterozygous Factor V Leiden. No relevant meds

I'm going on a cross-country drive soon that will require being in the car for 12 hours a day for three straight days. I'm planning on stopping every 2-3 hours to stretch, but I was wondering if it would be a good idea to wear compression socks/stockings while I'm on the road. I'm heterozygous for Factor V, so I have some anxiety about being sedentary for such a long time. I have no prior history of blood clots, have an IUD (no estrogen), and don't have a family history of DVT as far as I know. When I was diagnosed, my doctor didn't seem overly concerned about my chances of getting a clot, so this is more of a better safe than sorry scenario. So, any downsides to picking up a pair of compression socks for the road?

I did a search but didn't find much.

I tend to hyperfocus on different symptoms of different mental illnesses.

And they may be legit.

But I can't tell if I am having epiphanies and finally learning the issues that have affected me all my life, or if this is some never ending cycle, and that maybe I get some kick out of diagnosing myself, and maybe fooling myself with confirmation bias whenever I relate with a list of symptoms.

Maybe I'm just now realizing it could be one of my obsessions.

I have an ADHD and anxiety and dysthymia diagnosis. I also see alot of OCD tendencies.

I just don't see the topic of mental illness obsession talked about much in regards to OCD.

I'm currently in search of an OCD specialist.

Yet over time I've seen little to no improvement. I played collegiate ultimate frisbee and now I do crossfit 5+ times a week. But regardless of what I do, my body redlines and my HR hits 170-180 immediately. My resting HR is in the 60's.

selftext: I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since basically puberty. I am 21 now. I was on anti-anxiety meds until last summer and then I quit. For a while, I was doing really well-- better than ever. However, over the spring, I have started having much more physical manifestations of my anxiety than I ever had before-- pounding heart, tight chest, general feeling of physical sickness that was hard to shake. I also started to go through days where I felt very dreamy and disconnected to the world in a disturbing way. I never had such intense manifestations of my anxiety before and they are happening more and more often to the point that they make me feel incapacitated and are disrupting my life. 
Nothing in my life has particularly changed, I haven't had any sort of trauma or upsetting life event. 
Any idea what might be going on?

selftext: Hello, I've been scrolling through this sub for a week or so. I finally feel like there could be hope for me. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression disorders even though "the symptoms aren't exactly right." I've been  on different meds at different strengths since I was 14 and took myself to a doctor.  My mother was young, didnt have any help from anyone in raising me and maintained a "there's nothing wrong with my child," attitude. Each medication made me feel different and sometimes even better but never ok.

I've never been comfortable, or liked myself, or felt worthy of anything.

Despite wanting to be left alone and feeling nervous around  people I can't seem to shut up. I constantly yammer on and on about anything and everything.

I can't give an honest answer as to why I've done anything. I just, do. I hate it.

Since my teens I've gone through these intense mood fluctuations. For a few days to weeks (the time varies) I'll be extremely happy and positive. I tend to sleep less and be really confident, pretty much just feel super good. Then out of nowhere I'll go into and intensely depressed and anxious mood for some amount of time for no apparent reason. I'll convince myself everyone hates me and isolate myself from everyone. I found my medication helps so much with my mood fluctuations by making them less extreme and shortening my depressive time. I'm just curious to see if anyone else with ADHD has had a similar experience. Or maybe this isn't related to my ADHD at all

I was diagnosed about two or three months ago. Treating it with Ritilian (successful, but not long lasting) and am about to try Strettera. I'm also exploring additional ways to manage and this subreddit has been fantastic in giving me insight into how other people are dealing with this.

Over the last few weeks, now that I have a greater understanding of the things i do, often unconsciously, I'm increasingly see symptoms in others, which frankly helps me understand myself a little more. 

Anyone ever have similar moments when you suddenly see others showing ADHD traits and getting insight into yourself?

To say this is a new fear would be lying; I sometimes cry over the idea one day, in another accident I might end up completely blind. I only see light and movements in my left; my right eye is perfect according to all my eye specialists.

Ive talked it over with my mom, doctors, therapists, but their comfort doesn't really help me; *they* can see out of both eyes. I cannot.
I am told to count my blessings; its not like a degenerative illness, but I cant stop crying over the issue that one day it will all be over for my sight... and then what?

A lot of “recents” in my life right now - the two largest of which are being diagnosed with ADHD and coming to terms with the fact that I am (at least mostly) gay. It’s been a messy couple of months, but now I’m starting to adjust to taking Adderall and am actually starting to date women for the first time. 

I was wondering if any other queer women with ADHD would be willing to share their coming out experience and/or a little about their first lesbian relationship. I can’t figure out if I’m doing weird hyper-focus, obsessed-with-this-girl stuff, or if this is falling in line with all the lesbians-fall-fast stereotypes I’m always hearing. 

I’m having a hard time trusting myself because I keep thinking that these feelings are wrapped up in my ADHD, but I don’t want them to be. Any insights, or similar experiences?

They baisically told me "it means your bad at relationships"?? Doing my own research I found out more about BPD and discovered the truth that it is WAY more than that. 

Well, they were right about something; I am REALLY bad at maintaining friendships and relationships. I'm 19 and I've never experienced a best friend. Of course, I had people who came and went, but all my friendships and relationships have ended horribly messy or we just drifted. Every friend I have had has either been super manipulative and controlling or leaves because my BPD and other mental illnesses are too much to handle. 

So, here's my question, how have you guys found true friends and how did you work to maintain a friendship with them? 

Thanks for reading.

(ex: things will look smaller than they actually are.) as well as not being able to remember most years of my childhood from age 5-14 a month ago i heard about bpd and was researching the symptoms. im only 16 so i know most psychiatrist wont diagnose it and thats what makes me scared of making an appointment. because i dont want my concerns to be dismissed after finally coming to terms with the fact that what im going through is not normal.

Two weeks ago I went to bed with a burning red bump on my face and when I woke up it had turned into blisters that popped partially as I was washing my face in the morning. They appeared to have a yellow tinge. During the day I went to work and when I got home it seemed like one ulcer surrounded by red skin. 

This ulcer disappeared over night and I was left with red skin for a week after. It never had the scab or crust I have seen in cold sore pictures online, it kind of just dried up and had white, flaking skin. The white skin could have been a scab but it was not honey colored. It was on my left side, an inch away from my mouth. During this whole time I had no pain at all. Except for the night when it was burning, I would not even have known it was on my face. I may have previously had a cold sore on my upper right lip before but never officially diagnosed. 

I would just like to know opinions for future reference. Thank you!!

I see a lot of people who were diagnosed young here (and elsewhere) who sort of have a "I'm incapable of doing anything because I'm autistic" mentality. 

I hope this isn't rude but I'm happy I was diagnosed later.

I went to college, was expected to get a job by my parents the second I turned 16, have a career, etc. it's been SUPER HARD, don't get me wrong--I still fuck up on the daily and I am FAR LESS RESPONSIBLE/have my shit together a lot less than NTs. But I'm making my way in life however slowly. 

My dad was never diagnosed. He owns a successful business and makes a ton of money (though his business partner handles 99% of the social stuff because he can't). My dad is the brains behind the business; his partner is the social aspect. He admits he likely has autism, but that it hasn't stopped him from living.

I don't mean this to be ableist either. I know not all autistic people are capable of "living like the NTs" and I don't want to assume we all WANT TO live like NTs. But I'm glad I guess I didn't grow up with this attitude that I was incapable.

selftext: **appologies for the long post, it got away from me, tl;dr at the end**

So I'm 23, and I got diagnosed with ADHD last year. Well, diagnosed a 2nd time. The first time I was diagnosed was at the ripe old age of 5. How do I know this? I'll get to that. First, lets introduce the reasons I had no clue about my *cute* quirk;

My dear old mother and father. Their only daughter, their bright child, has been diagnosed with a mental illness!!! The horror! They quickly rug sweep, and immidiatly leave the doctor who dared tell them their daughter is anything but perfect.

Cue the next... hmmm... 15 years or so of me feeling like there is something wrong with me. I was always hyper, never shut up, brain going a million miles an hour, pissing every teacher off as I came through their class, and was in general, *that* child. I was a litmas test for teachers. If they were good, they loved and tolerated me. If they were bad, I would be basically tourtured (has anyone else had talking cards or the desk directly in front of the teacher? Yup, and most of the time without prompting). When I hit 16, I was exculed by my friends, and I began to fall into a depression, and my anxiety began to increase as I headed towards year 12. 

Throughout all of my schooling, I was screamed at, slapped and punished for not getting the grades my parents wanted, and not paying attention in class. This was my fault.

I used to do competitive swimming until I moved to Australia at 10 (not my choice). I was punished for not listening to the swimming coaches, and bobbing my head underwater instead of paying attention. This was my fault. 

I was threatened, yelled at and was slapped when my university grades weren't up to scratch. I was doing a bachelor I didn't want to do, but they forced me to continue anyway. This was my fault.

 They blammed video games distracting me. They told me my depression was a hormonal thing, that I would get past it. When I didn't, it was my fault. When I gained weight because of my anxiety and depression, it was also my fault, and even though I am obese now, I was skinny when they began this barade on my body.

We arrive at the day I found out. 2015. My dear old mother is having yet another yelling match at me, for being in bed. See, I was unable to sleep at night. Brain was too active, and I was bored. Through this screaming, she slips up. When I yelled at her "maybe it's because I'm depressed", she yells back "you're not depressex, you're just lazy". I yell "theres something wrong with me", and here is the golden words that clicked what was wrong with me
"Its your fucking ADHD"

...what? My adhd? The fuck is that? I stormed out the house and went to my gf's house. I researched what Adhd meant, and it all clicked.

The sleepless nights, the constant bordom, the hyper nonstop talking, my foot always being in my mouth, my eratic way of thinking, the reason I could look at every outcome, and the reason I could never concentrate on my studies. 

Tuns out, my parents didn't want a daughter who wasn't perfect. So they kept telling me it was all my fault. That I needed to concentrate better, that I needed to shut up, that I needed to stop playing video games.

At the beginning of 2017, I dropped out of university. My mother disowned me over this, and regretted it later that day when my father came home. I was already seeing a therapist for my anxiety and depression, so I asked for a referal to a psychologist for a diagnosis of adhd (for which she agreed). I finally was diagnosed in July of 2017. I was put on my medication.

I am now about to finish my certificate 3 in early childood education, planning to move on to my diploma and eventually my bachelor of teaching. I want to be a role model for all those children who think they're the odd ones out. They're not, you just have different abilities to everyone else.

I have never been happier to be able to manage my adhd, and it not be the other way around. So yeah, that's the story of how I found out about my ADHD

*tl:dr; parents hid my adhd from me at 5, found at during an argument at 20 that I have adhd, life makes sense, I get help, and I am functioning and am living the dream**

I got a new therapist last year to get some some more intense therapy, because the anxiety still plays a huge role in my life. She noticed how bad my body image was and said I have body dysmorphic disorder. I will be following extra therapy. I want to be able to accept my body and be proud of what it has gone through. I want to stop looking up cosmetic surgeries constantly, and I want to stop skipping out on things like vacations, nights out or being intimate. I want to feel beautiful. Besides therapy, do you have any good tips/recommendations on accepting flaws? What has helped you build confidence about something you used to hate about your face/body?

I suspect my mother's side of the family is plagued with some kind of genetic disease affecting males. My maternal grandmother had 9 pregnancies (7 males and 2 females). 6 boys were miscarried and one died shortly after birth. My maternal aunt has a son with severe developmental delays and has no diagnosis. He is 8 and is not able to talk or comprehend most things. He is not diagnosed, which is most likely because he lives in rural romania and does not have access to quality hospitals (doctors in rural romania are mainly either corrupt or underqualified). My mother only has one child (me). There are no males on my mom's side that are healthy. Thinking about this, I suspect there to be some genetic disease that runs in my family but I want to know what medical professionals think about this before discussing it with my family and getting tested.

I even will turn down any benefit programs that I qualify for just to prove to myself that I don't need them. They tell me that I need to stop thinking about it. That it's not even noticeable and I should just move on and not worry about it because It's holding me back as a person. I know they're right but I still can't help but worry that being open about it would only hurt me.

New to this subreddit. Long story short I was diagnosed with aspergers as a kid around 13 years old. I never fit in with most people growing up. Folks put me through a ton of counselling. Also gave me alot of attention  (only child) I am now 24, going back to school in the fall to continue college as a junior (already obtained associate's) to study sociology. I sometimes wonder if I truly have aspergers. Anytime I tell someone I have aspergers they are shocked. They say "I never would have guessed!" Some even ask if I think I really have it. I am pretty good at reading social ques. I am a decent communicator. Although it feels like sometimes I have to put in more work than others. I have a few obsessions, not just one. My obsessions also change. Anyone have any thoughts? I hope my title is not offensive! If it is I apologize

selftext: I went to my first intake appointment today at a psychiatrist office. I saw a counselor and we talked about why I was there and what not. Knowing that I have problems with memory, incomplete thoughts/jumbled thoughts and straying from the topic I  had brought a journal with me that I had been writing in for a few weeks so that I could discuss it. 
ADD being ADD, I used none of what I wrote and the councilor focused on my anxiety and depression because she skipped to other questions and I went along with her format. Not nessisarily bad but not all I was going in for. I feel like a lot was left out in my nervousness.

Thankfully I'll be having a psychiatric evaluation next so I can hopefully expand on my mental health. I was diagnosed with ADD as a child but it's so hard to accurately articulate what I go through on a day to day basis. I tend to freeze in conversations
Any tips for future appointments?

I am diagnosed with anxiety and I know how anxiety can make you feel, but I feel like my doctor needs to take me more seriously. She never does any tests. She hasn't done blood work or EKG's in months. I feel like there is something wrong but I don't know how to get my doctor to listen to me. She's a great doctor, don't get me wrong. Any advice?

selftext: I searched ADHD and found this Sub, I hope it reaches a few people.

So, I have a final tomorrow morning and although I am more or less confident that I'm going to do well, my Adderall prescription from my doctor didn't get mailed in time. Now I'm without meds and feeling frustrated. I've studied hard, but I never did well on tests or in school before I was diagnosed. I've done far better in college than I could have imagined. I still don't believe it when I get A's. But I have a hard time not seeing my medication as a factor, I know it is. I'll be honest, I hate the stigma I'm feeling from even posting this. From what I've seen this is the place to post this, as well as the place to say how much I hate the judgement I feel for even presenting this. I wanted some advice and am hoping this is the place the find it.

selftext: I’ve going on about suicide to my friends for the longest amount of time. At first, it wasn’t bad.. then it started to get worse. I began self harming, and I attempted to kill myself twice. Once two weeks ago, and another one tonight. I tried to hang myself, but I was scared that my drunk dad would beat me if I survived the attempt. I’m planning on doing it again soon when there’s no one around. My girlfriend (or ex) knew that I was diagnosed with depression. But yet, she told me that she doesn’t care. My world shattered, felt like no one cared if I died tonight or not. It’s 4am and I tired. I don’t know why I decided to write this. I guess I just wish that by some stroke of miracle, things change. But looking at it now, things will only change when I just die. Sorry for rambling, just wanted to let my emotions out.

selftext: Today has been a really rough day. No, there's no logical reason. I mean I do have a lot of stressful things going on, but what frustrates me is sometimes I can handle it, sometimes I literally curl into a ball. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression, but I feel like it is more bi-polar. 90% of the time I feel completely hopeless and so down that I can't function. The other 10% I feel "normal" or my idea of normal, and it's these times when I realize how real this is. I can't even begin to enjoy when I feel OK because I know it's a matter of minutes or hours before I'm right back in the abyss. Isolation is now all the time instead of most of the time. I feel SO nervous around people that it makes it completely unbearable to even try to socialize. It's I'm down in a hole with the only way out being a ladder greased with Crisco.

selftext: I have been diagnosed with treatment resistant depression. I've been on Effexor for about 10 years, dosages from 225mg/day to 375mg/day. I'm currently on 300mg/day. I am going to ask my psychiatrist to refer me for ketamine infusion treatment because at the moment I feel like I'm in some kind of a grey hole and every day takes so much effort. It feels like it's taking so much of my strength just to walk my dog. 

But, I know Effexor withdrawals are horrendous. I've forgotten to get prescriptions filled before and had the diarrhoea, the insane nightmares, the terrible sweats, the headaches, the horrific low mood... so I thought it might be worth trying to crowdsource experiences. If you've come off Effexor before - how did you do it? What dosages did you reduce by? How bad were the side effects? When did you feel it was truly out of your system?

Any help gratefully received...

My best friend stopped talking to me in September because I was screwing up my relationships with everyone because of my mental health and the fact I'm a toxic person to be around.

My boyfriend broke up with me just before my diagnosis and since then I've made him and a lot of my closest friends hate me by fucking up real bad. 

I hate my job and no matter how much I apply for new ones, nothing really comes of it. I'm miserable in the city I live in and my boyfriend had plans for me to move to his city, but obviously not anymore.

Three days later I found myself with nicotine gum. That didnt work either. Four days later I found a patch on my arm. For a week it was great. I woke up this morning in the middle of a violent panic attack that I had to ride out. Believing I could help myself, I went for a walk. I got home, and had another panic attack. Now I've smoked 2 cigarettes and my suicidal ideations are back. If my bottle of prescription clonazepam wasn't almost empty, I would've swallowed them and just went to sleep. Meditation hasn't helped. Exercise hasn't helped. My team of therapists and doctors hasn't helped. And to top it off I'm extremely nihilistic. So I'm begging you. Please help me.

Except for the fact that my mood states can last for weeks rather than just hours or days and others often become concerned and make comments about how I appear to be on drugs. I know I look like it too because my pupils get all dilated and stuff, but that's beside the point.

I really feel like I made this whole thing up for attention. I've been stable for about a month now despite missing my meds a few times. I haven't felt this great in a while. I'm not exactly bursting with energy, but I'm just sort of content with everything.

I’ve been working as a teacher for over 11 years and I love(d) it, especially working with adolescents. However, me work requires to do a lot of planning, organising, grading etc. Which seems to be more difficult for me than my colleagues, and to be honest, I’ve grown so tired of them. I tend to make a mess out of a lot of things even though my colleagues and students always tell me I’m good at my job. But it sure doesn’t feel like that most of the time. I’m really thinking about switching careers to something that requires more practical skills and less ‘head’ skills. I just feel I need change to feel excited and happy again. 

Who made a career change like that? What were your reasons and how did you like it?

I know tantrums can also be pain-related, and now I'm questioning them because today, I think she lost some time.  We got home with dinner and she sat down to eat and was like "I was just over there (pointing outside) with daddy, how did I get here?"  We're calling her doc on Monday and are probably going to be referred to a pediatric neurologist, but there are literally none in our area.  Our options would be Johns Hopkins in Baltimore or going to someone in DC.  The drive is about the same for us, either way.  Those of you with experience, where would you choose?

selftext: My ex\-gf \(of 4 yrs\) has always been struggling with anxiety and was diagnosed with GAD. She broke up with me out of nowhere recently, after a heavy anxiety attack, after which she claims to have lost all feeling for me and the relationship. This attack was due to concerns about not being there for me enough in a period where I have been suffering from poor health \(broke a limb, mental issues due to work\). I asked her to support me in this period and was more needy than otherwise, and this seems to have been the final stroke for her anxiety to flourish once again. The change in caregiver role \(i.e. I usually took care of her\) and communication \(I'm usually too busy to message her all the time, and now I was bored at home recovering\) seems to have totally upset her. DAE recognize that it is problematic/hard for someone with anxiety to have to bear that burden all of a sudden? Or deal with such changes?

History: PKD, Chlosterol Granuloma, Crohn's, Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

So, I was diagnosed with a chlosterol granuloma over four years ago. It started with dizziness, hearing issues, a headache, eye watering, etc. I had my first surgery (tympanoplasty/mastoidectomy) two years after, with no success. Following year, and craniotomy, at that time they filled the area with fat and called it a day. Problem is, the headaches never stopped. 

I've been since told it's migraines. I've had botox, Topamax, Imitrex, and a variety of other meds. Nothing has worked. But the headache always comes from the exact spot of the granuloma, nowhere else. It's not a migraine, and nobody believes me. What do I do from here? 

The surgery to fill it left fluid in the area still, not as much cystic tissue, but still fluid. Am I just extremely sensitive to things being in my petrous apex? What gives?

I've been diagnosed with OCD, and I've displayed symptoms almost my entire life. I know most of you here don't believe that "mental illnesses" are indeed an "illness." 

Obviously, everyone's brain is different, and I think that a lot of supposed illnesses are just the brain's natural reaction to things that happen around us.

However, even if I concede that OCD isn't an illness, does that inherently mean I'm mentally *well*? My brain still operates differently than the majority of other people, and it still causes me distress. Am I supposed to completely disregard this, given that it's not a literal illness? 

Sorry for any misconceptions, but from what I've gathered a lot of people here don't even know what OCD is. One of the recent posts described it as simply being "meticulous," which is blatantly wrong. I just want to hear what you guys really think about all this.

I'm 21 (healthy, without bad habits) and I'm almost 24hs a day taking my heart rate, putting my hand over my chest to check my heart beat (if it's slow, fast, week, strong). Sometimes I feel like my heart starts beating harder (or/and faster) when I'm doing daily things like taking a bath, also when I'm changing my clothes or just standing up after being in the bed for a couple of minutes. I don't know If its my normal heart "rythm" or if I'm over focusing this thing so I'm hyper-aware of my heart sensations.
Last year I had a stress ECG test and a doppler echocardiography, everything came back normal, but I think I may talk about this with my doctor. How can I stop my mind until then?

selftext: Hi everyone, 
I was wondering how your first few weeks/months have been after being diagnosed. How did you take to it? 

I'll share my story, as it's pretty fresh; I'm a software engineer and have been for the past decade, but only a year ago~ have I bothered starting a college degree.

I've struggled for exactly 26 years. Although I was diagnosed at an early age my mum wouldn't medicate me. As I got older I grew anti-meds and started doing mindfulness meditation, tried to see a psychologist, would use all sorts of now useless meditation apps, and I would still forget what I wanted to say mid-sentence, would still wonder about the wood my desk is made of mid-calculus exams, and would still drive my spouse insane, not remembering chores, or events, or to feed the cats or even fill their water bowl. Oh, we're on vacation today? sorry, I forgot we were supposed leave at 7:00 because my phone event notification didn't go off. I even missed my high school graduation ceremony!

I never knew how bad my ADD was until I took a computerized ADHD test off and on ritalin. My score SKYROCKETED on it. My head was finally starting to work. I cried when I realized how clear I was. When the doctor gave me a prescription for 2 weeks I was thrilled to try it. Finally, the clouds in my head dissipated, my grades shot up to A+ from C, my hated college calculus became my favorite subject. I like maths now. This is 3 weeks I'm talking about. I feel like I've wasted 26 years of my life. I could have had a masters by now! why did I deny myself this normality for more than 2 decades?! My work performance has doubled, my JIRA tickets are being completed like a kanban board in a tornado.

I'm focused, I remember, and I'm finally not even annoying. I don't interrupt conversations because I didn't notice someone else was talking, my calendar is in my phone but finally also in my head, organized in mental drawers. Insane. I actually participated in a college class today, answered the lecturer's questions correctly and people were staring at me. No one even knew who I was since I always fell asleep/stared at my computer all throughout the lecture.

I was prescribed Concerta for daily use today, and I can't wait to start my new life.

selftext: Of all the therapists and psychiatrists I've seen throughout my life, they have all seemed to arrive to different conclusions about my mental health, or have different criteria for diagnoses. I'm getting so annoyed and confused with different therapists labeling me differently or refuting the information I tell them about myself. I need them to understand me in order to help me and do their job, but so many times I feel like they just misunderstand me. Sometimes I leave appointments feeling more confused than I went in.

Today, I made an emergency appointment at the university's student health center. The therapist asked me about my history of trauma, etc, and told me she doesn't think I have BPD, after another therapist has told me I likely do, because last summer I felt happy and confident. Like, what? She doesn't know me and is labeling me and using weird criteria to base diagnoses on... 

Anyway, what has your experience been with therapists and psychiatrists evaluating and diagnosing you? I see a new psychiatrist in two weeks and I want to give him as much info about myself as possible and hope he listens. How can I best represent my story and symptoms?  I use the Daylio app so I will show him that for sure.

selftext: Hi I've been reading through this thread for a few weeks after I got diagnosed with depression about a month ago.

I think I've been depressed for over four years, but my family and my general environment made me believe for a long time that nothing could be worse than mental health. My mom still doesn't think depression is real.

Anyway I was finally convinced by my friend to go to a doctor and explain how I'd been feeling. I knew I was going to be told that I was depressed, but I didn't realize how much I didn't want to hear it until I did. I have been in denial for so long that when the doctor was so calm and casual about it, I felt super uncomfortable.

Since my diagnosis my breakdowns and suicidal thoughts have gotten much worse and more frequent, and I've lost the little motivation I had previously. I feel like before I was diagnosed I could just pretend that some of my problems weren't that bad and that I was fine, and now anytime I feel unmotivated to exist I use the fact that I'm depressed as an excuse to allow myself to do nothing.

I just started meds and I'm looking for a therapist so I'm hoping I'll start getting better soon.

I was wondering did anyone else's diagnosis make them feel worse? Did you feel relieved, did you not care? And is it possible that I am overreacting and this is all just in my head?

selftext: I've been mulling over my diagnosis since my psychiatrist prescribed me Ritalin. I trust him and his advice has always been good so I feel rude telling him I want to also consider treatment for chronic anxiety or maybe get assessed for aspergers. I've always been pretty accepting of his diagnoses but now I'm actually freaking out, much more than when I got diagnosed with bipolar.

What I'm questioning is the adult onset, which from what I've read online has kind of split the psychiatry community. The record of my childhood I gave to my psych has no indication of ADHD: my academic performance wasn't due to hyperfocus because I did everything well, no restlessness, no pressured speech, no daydreaming/distractability, no behaviour difficulties, etc. If anything I was a model child. Symptoms like these began only at 15 years old and even then it only became worse *gradually* over a decade. Aren't symptoms meant to be bad from the start? From what I know of ADHD that isn't how it presents. If I had a few symptoms as a kid then sure, that could mean there's something latent and its manifested, but this just... happened.

Our brains are all unique and confusing though I'm pretty stumped by this. I'm wondering if I just need to keep popping the Ritalin (which hasn't been helping very much) or need to get a second opinion. 

Did any adult onset-ers here experience this?

selftext: I'm almost two weeks out of a poly triad with one of the SOs being either bipolar or having BPD(she won't get help or a proper diagnosis). The love I received from her was otherworldly. The intimacy was unparalleled. The good times were great, but the bad times were hell.

I haven't been diagnosed as an adult, but as a teenager I was twice diagnosed with manic depression. I can be a handful at times due to my tendencies to be negative about new situations and things that stray away from my familiar levels of comfort.

Our fights always came out of the blue, like when we'd have a disagreement about something as trivial as music. She also self harms, yet doesn't take responsibility. Instead, it's something like "YOU pushed ME to do THIS". Sometimes, they're as small as a cat scratch. On occasions, she cuts deeper and will leave a scar. The other member of our relationship blamed me, said they'd never forgive me, and  was lucky she didn't kill herself.

Perhaps I'm just not equipped to deal with a bipolar/BPD significant other. Perhaps it's because of my depression, or perhaps I'm just not a good partner overall. I do know that I feel like garbage because she cut herself, and if she had committed suicide I'd take that guilt to my grave.

Is it normal to feel this way?

Just when my depression started when I was 16 I took interest in kawaii fashion, and alternative fashion, tattoos etc. I wanted to be skinny but never believed in myself that I am going to actually do it. A year later I tried to lose weight by starving myself and then relapsed into binge eating and then decided to purge it all out. This happened for a while and my doctor diagnosed me with bulimia. My weight yoyoed a lot and now I am back on 180lbs just where I started. I feel worthless even more, I can't sleep, I sleep every other day, I am filled with guilt, I don't take showers anymore, shave myself, wash my hair, even forget to brush my teeth sometimes, and my room is a mess. I also wear male clothing and I can't even bring myself to buy nice feminine clothing until I lose weight, I am also waiting to lose weight before I get a tattoo. I think Ill be happy once I lose weight but I couldn't even reach my goal for 2 years. I don't know what to do. Should I just give up in losing weight, maybe I should just kill myself because I am worthless? I think If for those 2 years I never could lose weight I never will.

selftext: This post is a culmination of events. Today my sister has been charged with drink driving and I’m not sure if I’m glad she has, for her own safety and of others.

It’s very likely she will be found guilty and given her blood alcohol content, she will likely receive a custodial sentence and between 29 - 36 months driving ban.

Prior to this, she was arrested for drink driving but not charged, purely due to the time she was reported to the time she was arrested, I suspect it would have been a difficult case to make in court. I thought this was a wake up call for her but unfortunately that proved not to be the case.

I had to drive her home from work because she was clearly drunk at work. Twice. We work for the same company by the way.

To give you an idea of who she is - she’s an amazing person wrestling a lot of demons. We lost our older brother 10 years ago in a car accident. My little boy was diagnosed with Leukaemia in 2015 and she has been an amazing and constant source of support for me. Shortly after my little boy was diagnosed, her 8yo niece (by marriage) was diagnosed with a terminal DIPG brain tumour and passed away November 2016.

It’s been a rough couple of years and I worry that what we have been through is enabling her behaviour by preventing people that are close to her intervening. I say this, because I know I’ve been guilty of excusing her behaviour.

Whatever happens in court in the next few weeks is beyond my control. I know that. I’m worried now that she is almost certainly going to lose her driving license, she might feel she has nothing to lose.

Just wanted to check if this is something I should be concerned about.

So I fell awkwardly on my foot last Saturday, felt quite the pop, nearly blacked out from the pain and went to Urgent Care. They x-rayed it and diagnosed me with a chip fracture on the first metatarsal and a possible fracture on the second.

Now, starting yesterday, I noticed some bruising start at the base of my three middle toes, and over today (Tuesday) it has considerably darkened and begun to spread down my middle toe. Foot is still stiff but feels better when in a shoe, so I might have overdone it today catching up on errands.

I see a foot specialist on Thursday morning but I'm just concerned about this much bruising happening rapidly three days after the incident. Anything to worry about or should I just keep icing and elevating? Would wrapping it help or make it worse?

Thanks!

selftext: Hey, how's it going guys, before i get to the issue i will fill you in with some info about me, (excuse my poor english)

* I'm a female of 49 years old, about 90 kgs in weight and a little shorter than 170 cm.
+ I have been diagnosed with "Type 2 diabetes" about a year ago.
- I don't smoke (never), drink alcohol (never) and never had any medical incedents except for diabetes.

With that out of the way, let's get to the real issue...
A few months ago i started suffering from the lack of sleep, i barely get 3~4 hours of sleep a day, i don't drink coffee and i'm quite an active person. The problem is that no matter how tired or exhausted i am i never seem to sleep longer than 3 hours, i'd just suddenly wake up tired and completely incapable of going back to sleep, even the slightest movment would wake me up. I'm really just looking for a way around this, a certain medicine maybe? Thanks in advance.

selftext: It's been almost 2 months since I moved to a new country. For the first week or so the culture shock was so severe that I didn't go outside unless required to. I was constantly having mild anxiety attacks. I couldn't find the will to live anymore. 

Now, I have a daily routine, combining light exercise, studies, creative stuff and light socializing. I try to find out people I know back from home and connect with them. My mind is brimming with ideas. I haven't felt this grateful or excited in a long while.

I am still having anxiety attacks occasionally but I am better equipped to handle them now.

Thing is, I have been in this kind of high before. So I am skeptical about how long this will last. 

I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar disorder yet, but sometimes the cyclic nature of my depression makes me wonder.

Do you guys have anything to suggest  about this? Any relevant ideas, insights and stories are welcome.

I feel hopeless and useless a lot of the time. Some people around (I'm being vague on purpose) me aren't necessarily encouraging and have made me feel like shit almost my whole life. I get this thought in my mind that if I killed or hurt myself and blamed them, then maybe they would finally understand they can't treat me anyway they want just because they feel it's okay. That I do matter and I need to be respected. I need to be spoken to as a person who is intelligent. If I killed myself it would be the final "Well, are you happy now!?!" 

I realize that this post may seem silly and I might come off as a whiny child but it's how I feel and my thoughts.

selftext: For me to be diagnosed with Asperger's my mum had to come on the 30 minute bus journey to see a psychologist. She had to tell him what I was like between the ages of 0-5, etc.  Anyway, he said I was on the spectrum and while waiting for the bus home my mum said "Why do people who have interests in things get labelled, yet people who are willfully ignorant don't get a medical term to describe them?"  or words to that effect.  Is she right?  I thought it was a good point but I think for a lot of people a diagnosis is a way to explain why we are as we are.  It certainly helped me in that respect.  Asperger's does run in my family on my mum's side but I am the only one to get a diagnosis, as far as I know.  I think my maternal uncle is on the spectrum; he is an expert on Swiss watches, cigars, Muhammad Ali, obscure films, and gadgets, amongst other things.

selftext: Hi r/OCD!

I'm new and have joined because after supporting my fiance in finding medical help for over 2 years, and this week he was diagnosed with OCD.

The reason I'm here is because of our sex life. Basically he feels like sex gets in the way of whatever he's doing and he has an incredibly low sex drive. I was hoping to find out if anyone else feels that way about sex and how they handle it?

For the record, I am a highly emotional mood disorder individual who loves having sex with her fiance. I would do it every day if I could! He is much different, very technical and nerdy, plus he needs to schedule things way in advance  (sometimes even sex). He has a highly stressful job that is made even more stressful due to his obsessive need to complete his tasks. He's always interrupted which ends up making things so much worse.

What I was hoping for is to see if anyone else has any problems similar to these?

selftext: I switched to the Juul a little over a month ago. Since then, I haven't bought a pack, but I **have** smoked a couple of cigarettes, namely when I went out with friends and they had cigs and offered me. I never really intended to quit smoking, I just intended to quit regularly smoking, but not mind the occasional cigarette, like some of my friends are.

However, today I've been really missing cigarettes. I surfed /r/cigarettes for a bit and looking at all the different brands and blends brought back to me why I liked smoking: I enjoy it. Not to mention, I've been feeling slightly *off* for the past few days (not making excuses here, but I am diagnosed with bipolar, so while I've been stable for a while, I think the stress of the end of the semester is starting to trigger some things in me), with the addition of finals stress, and it's these ingredients that led me to smoke in the first place.

Kinda just venting here, I guess.

It's been a little over 2 months, and now I'm going back to feeling like I really don't care every day. Everything was going good - depression was down to 1 episode/mood per month it seemed like. Totally tolerable. Now It's just almost every day - and it's to the point where I almost can't handle another day of it. 

My boyfriend who I've been with for over a year, and known him for 2+ years - he's been with me from the beginning of this. He knows what caused it, etc. Says I'm not a burden or bothering him - but now, I just feel like I'm a constant burden.

Going through a rocky time (broke up with long term girlfriend, moved back in with family, doing a dead-end job that's getting worse) and I just feel so wired all the time. No one would guess as I'm outwardly relaxed and content, but inside my brain is running a mile a minute, I sometimes feel like I cant eat and when I do I just feel sick all day.

All of my longest friends are far away and my work friends have their own circles, I feel like the odd one out. Went to a friend's yesterday to try socialize and ended up sitting in silence while him and his housemates talked about other people I've never met. It's making me feel so alone.

Does anyone have any tips for relaxing? And what do people do when they feel alone? First time in my life I've not had a partner with me, I don't know who else to talk to.

I have a late diagnosis for ADHD. I’m 27 and struggled most of my life with basic tasks. Did some digging and talked to my doctor and he diagnosed me and sent a referral to a psychologist. He prescribed me with concerta to try and see if that helped with my day to day. 

I am on day four of the medication 38 mg slow release.  I noticed a spike in blood pressure yesterday (I have my own machine at home) at resting it was 138/87 while on the medication. Waking up this morning and checking while I had no drug in my system it was 113/74

Wondering if this is something that has happened with anyone else when they started and it regulated after a while, or if they had to switch medication because of it. 

Aside from that the medication is wonderful. I can actually have conversations with people and I can sit down at work and actually accomplish things!

I was diagnosed very early on as bipolar but I had a hard time with Lithium so the doctor took me off of it and started me on Effexor for major depression instead. No doctors have ever done any blood/genetic testing on me, they just guess and off I go. To be honest the constant side effects are destroying my life. That and being on Prozac. I don't enjoy anything anymore.

selftext: I was diagnosed with BPD by a psychiatrist a few months ago and desperately want treatment. Unfortunately I live in an area of Texas that is lacking in MHP’s who both specialize in BPD/DBT and accept insurance. I am currently three sessions into seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, though her scheduling isn’t the most consistent because of the amount of clients she has. I like her so far, but she is not experienced with BPD and I’m not sure how much DBT she will be able to implement into the therapy, so I’m still kind of “shopping around”. I have a first session coming up with an LPC who’s bio states that she “relies heavily on DBT techniques” and will hopefully see her on a weekly basis as well if it works out.  Could it be helpful to continue seeing both therapists at once, or would it be best to see who I work best with after a few sessions and only stick with one?

I’ve always been highly irritable. The littlest of things can set me off. Examples of things that can highly irritate me: 

-my dog staring at me for no reason 
-when people peer at me in their side mirror rather than driving 
-when a car drives exactly next to me and I feel them looking at me 
-when my boyfriend tries to get into my clean bed with dirty clothes
-when people double to triple text me after it’s clear I’m not responding
-when people say things that are unnecessary. Example: Me: I went to see my Mom today. 
                   Them: Mary? (My only Mom) 
                   (No my other Mom.) 

I’ve been on Zoloft which has really helped a lot of my symptoms but I’m still experiencing a lot anxiety and irritation. I know it’s not “normal”.

Am I alone in this?

Whenever I have to give someone directions, or explain a concept, it's just really hard for me to communicate. 

It's been bothering me now because at work I have to explain certain concepts or problems &amp; my mind just blanks out. I can't think of the word or the way to describe and it's obvious that I'm struggling. Words &amp; putting them together just don't come to me. 

This happens when I think as well by the way. When I'm excited &amp; passionate about something, my thoughts flow easier but other than that...they're..just..like..this. 

I was diagnosed with ADD so there's definitely a slow processing issue which might be causing it as well but I'm taking meds for it. 

This leads me to not being as witty b/c I can't think on my feet quickly. When I have a phrase I'm comfortable with, I just keep using that b/c it's easier to remember but then I sound repetitive.

I was put on antidepressants but stopped taking them. It sometimes feels like my depression intermittently comes and goes - sometimes it’ll last a few days, sometimes months. I’ve been using alcohol for the past five years to try and mitigate it, but have finally realized that it isn’t doing me any good, as it’s basically ruined several of the relationships I’ve had in the past. 
I’m trying to make myself better but it feels like I’m turning my wheels and getting nowhere. I don’t like to talk about this with really anyone in my personal life, and just need someone to listen. This post may come off as whining to some and that’s okay. I’m just trying to make peace with myself and everything that has brought me to this point. Thanks for reading.

I've ALWAYS loved posting on social media but in the past month, I've found that I just feel kind of emotionally/mentally sick whenever I open up a social media app on my phone or begin to type a social media website on my computer.

I've felt incredulously lonely this year and connecting with others (particularly people I know irl) through my social media channels used to help me (especially when I was going through tough times as a pre-teen) but now it seems like the social media channels only make me feel lonelier and I feel like I'm wasting my time on them.

When I back down from going online though, I feel alone and don't know what to do with myself. It's kinda strange.

**TLDR; used to love social media, now I feel sick when I go on.**

Are all these feelings because of the depression? Does anyone feel the same way?

There are a number of "secret" social rules for myself, and secret ways of being. If I don't adhere to them, something terrible may occur. I'm chill with most things people do, but I couldn't allow myself to do them, despite desperately wanting to. I have become so rigid and reserved since I suffered from my first full blown psychotic break. \(I had mild psychosis before I got really sick\).

So I started reading about how alcohol affects one's mind. I learned a little about depression (I've been diagnosed with depression for a good ten years or so), gray matter and sensory perception (I'm a synesthete so this really hit me hard) and "brain fog" and such. I want my mind back and feel like I've wasted so much time, money and potential just to get heavenly highs and hellish lows from alcohol. I also changed my phone's lock screen into the art on this card, because that's THE picture I relate to most when being hung over. I wish it helps if and when the cravings hit me. Here: ( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=86&amp;type=card )

I guess I would like to discuss about what kind of changes YOU have experienced mentally after quitting, and what was your biggest motive to do so. For the former I would especially like to hear from fellow synesthetes.

In a writing group I go to, I find myself reading through other people’s works faster than normal and then get on my phone, leaving an inadequate amount of feedback on stories and not engaging as much in discussions. And just yesterday in an online RPG with people, I found myself tabbing over to YouTube whenever I’m not involved, drowning out other people in my headphones. Even when I’m focusing, it’s taking a few seconds to even register someone is talking to me in the call.

I've had a good life with loving, financially supportive parents and I've never been abused-- I think I wanted to find a way to feel special. I want to admit this to a doctor but I'm pretty confident that they'll write it off as a manic episode and try to put me on more drugs if anything. I've never had a manic episode in my life. I've never been suicidal or unable to take care of myself in my life. I've never been in a fight or physically harmed anyone.

Does anyone have experience feeling this way and admitting it to a doctor? How do I get taken seriously? I just want someone to hear my perspective (I have a lot of evidence) before they assume it's another bipolar symptom.

I try and form a thought and mid\-sentence... gone. Then it sounds like i'm stuttering and have no idea what I want to say or what I am responding to. I also have problems finishing a thought when I bring up a conversation. Now, close family notice it but I am getting extremely anxious that co\-workers and superiors will start noticing. 

I'm sorry if this seems like a rant lol, I just wanted others opinions on it.

I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety for the last 20 years. I've been medicated the last 10 of those. It's been totally disabling. I am unable to work due to cognition problems. It's made me so stupid, but inside I know I am smart. I am on SSDI due to the severity of my illness.

I really want to get better, but I am losing hope. I have a psychiatrist appointment Monday and I need some ideas of things I can ask her about. I am open to non-traditional routes.

Here are the meds I've tried: Paxil Lexapro Trazedone Xanax Buspar Visteral Klonopin Depakote Brintellix (now Trintellix) Seroquel Fetzima Wellbutrin Vibyrd Effexor Neurontin (gabapentin) Luvox Remeron Prozac Abilify Cogentin Rexulti Zoloft

I am also making good strides in therapy and another treatment group.

Help. Please!

selftext: I often hear how people with aspergers take things literally and have difficulty with sarcasm and expressions. It's related to being strict in the interpretation of language where a phrase can't be interpreted in different ways.

I have been diagnosed with ASD but I find myself to be the opposite. If anything I use sarcasm too much and people don't understand me, I try to play along with jokes and people wonder if I got the joke in the first place. I also learned Chinese and a second foreign language and sometimes the words are conceptualised in a different way. Like the chinese word for "avocado" is 牛油果 or literally "cow oil fruit", I don't have a problem imagining this to mean avocado.

As mentioned before, my loose/flexible use of language sometimes leaves others confused so I still have problems communicating. I wonder if anybody else feels like this or if you've heard of this kind of communication problem before.

selftext: Hi everyone-- I wanted to start this off by saying thank you to everyone posting on this sub. I was diagnosed with ADHD-C this week and I would not have gone through the process had it not been for the support I felt from this subreddit. I just started my first dose of Concerta today and I'm so happy to finally be working towards something.


**MY QUESTION**:
Do any of you feel like you need to keep a list of your friends to remember who you need to respond to / make plans with? I'm realizing I'm the flaky friend who will either drop off the face of the earth or cancel plans last minute because I've over-committed myself. 

I also find I need to spend a lot of time alone to "figure things out" (could be anything from figuring out plans or cleaning my room). I would say I'm an extrovert but I'm wondering if ADHD requires introverted habits because people are distracting? 

TL;DR: ADHD seems to give me poor friend habits

Anyone relate?

selftext: Hi, I'm (15F) not sure I have depression since I'm not diagnosed but my psychologist has told me that I have "symptoms of moderate depression". It's gotten to the point that I cannot function like a normal kid: I don't want to wake up each day because I have to deal with problems at school and at home. I get very strong feelings of self-hatred and in some cases, suicidal feelings. I often feel that if I wasn't born, my mom would have a better life, since I was very likely an accident and a first-born so I feel like I made my mom tied to my narc/abusive father. My mother is trying to get us to move away from him because he sexually abused me.

I often miss school and just sleep/cry all day because I feel like my life has no worth and I have no motivation to do absolutely anything.

EDIT: Not mild, moderate; Sorry, English is not my first language and I got them mixed up.

Hey all, I've been experiencing chest pain for a while now and was curious to see if anyone here can diagnose me. It started around 4 or 6 weeks ago, where I woke up after experiencing chest pain. It was a throbbing pain that lasted 10 minutes and occurred in minute long intervals. I experienced it again a few weeks later and have been experiencing it since 3:00PM today, which is around 5 hours. I have no other symptoms. It occurs in the centre of my chest a bit towards the left. I saw a doctor today but he wasn't really able to help me, I'm going to get an x ray done tommorow but am curious to see if anyone can help me out before then.

Just a bit of extra info; I'm a 20 year old Canadian male, my family history traces back to India, I'm very fit and active and don't have any pre-existing medical conditions. 5 ft 7, 150 lbs, 12% bodyfat. I'm not on any medications though I do take 5000mcg of biotin daily.

Is it normal to have E-coli bacteria present in a Urine sample?     
     
About a month ago I was diagnosed with a UTI and was given a course of antibiotics. All symptoms were gone and everything was fine. After a week. I started to experience tightness and muscle soreness (no pain) in my back. Thought I would go to the doc to check it out to make sure infection was gone. Dipstick said there was still bacteria in my urine and gave me another round of antibiotics (Macrobid). Finished that and the Urine Culture did not grow. Two weeks after that I'm still experiencing muscle soreness (no pain) in my back. Dispstick still says I have bacteria...but no symptoms of a UTI.     
     
My question is, is it normal to have bad bacteria in urine. Also could this be due to me eating fermented food every day?

selftext: I'm not diagnosed and I have a lot of autistic traits, so I'm exploring the possibility of getting assessed by a professional in the future. Despite having a lot of symptoms I am not quite sure about "inability to read social cues well". I usually score reasonably well in some online quizzes that are supposed to test one's ability to read body language &amp; facial expressions (like [this one](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/quiz/), I scored 61.6 which is 'great' apparently). However I think the expressions in these quizzes are very exaggerated and sometimes even when I don't know the answer I can guess it by simply eliminating more obvious options. I also read a book about non verbal language when I was 12 which kind of helps.                                  
In real life I am oftentimes confused about someone's expression or reaction, I can't tell when someone is joking with me but I can detect sarcasm by analyzing the context. Are these tests really a good way to test someone's ability to read social cues?

I recently started seeing a psychologist who thinks that I’m coping well and that I am not “there” yet. She thinks some talk therapy whenever an exceptionally stressful situation comes up is enough for now. 
I’m not sure if it’s normal to feel the way I feel though. Everyone around me seems to get their shit together even close friends whom I know have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders. I’m always exhausted from the simplest of tasks and as soon as I go home I crawl into bed, feel empty, lonely, confused, and and get an attack. I can never explain how I feel properly to the people around me. I’m not very fluent when it comes to talking about myself or asking for help. 

Should I see a psychiatrist? Is it time to seek medication?

I was diagnosed with pigment dispersion syndrome about a year ago and since then have had two bouts of uveitis, once in each which let up after about a week. In January, I saw a neuro-Ophthalmologist because of different pupil sized, and he ordered me an OCT, which showed swollen macula in both eyes, but didn't think it was concerning because my field tests were fine. Anyways, I couple things I noticed that I wanted to know more about us that 1) when I'm lying in bed in low light, I will open my eyes and see a very small blind spot in my central vision 2) I can see my retinal veins sometimes in the same situations and 3) I've noticed my dark vision isn't as good as it used to be. I was concerned about Wet Macular Degeneration and asked my ophthalmologist, but he doesn't think it could be that based on what he sees. I wasn't sure if this is normal or not.

Regardless, he’s always had a better grip on himself than I do. This month though, we’ve been arguing every single day, and I’m starting to think he’s fed up with me and has become hypervigilant (More [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8mc9nm/will_me_improving_save_our_relationship_is_he/) if anyone is willing to hear me out lol).

This made me wonder how other people on this subreddit are doing in their relationships. So, people on this subreddit (both pwBPD, or partners of someone with BPD) who are in relationships, how is your relationship going? How long have you been together, and what are your challenges? What are things you have overcome? Have you ever noticed a change in your partner in any way?

Of course, there’s no need to answer these questions, or any of them at all. I’m just curious of how other people are handling relationships. Thank you!

I'd say it's stressful enough for the average person let alone someone with anxiety. Ironically, I went in feeling confident and started off well. Mid-way through the examiners' cold faces and relentless pimping just broke me down. I had tears flowing down my face and a runny nose, all the works. I had to excuse myself while I grabbed a tissue from my bag and had to pause examining the patient at least twice to gain composure again. Somehow I managed to finish the exam and they must have warmed their stone cold hearts because they reassured me juuust a bit. 

However I'm worried I might fail, solely because of this crying/anxiety thing. Has anyone been through something similar? I need some kind words, I suffer from impostor syndrome as well :P

selftext: Intro post. I'm an adult. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD over a year ago and never told me. My family doctor knows too, and didn't tell me either. I am FURIOUS.

&amp;nbsp;

Just over a year ago, I was hospitalized again. I need to appeal my claim with my insurance company. I needed my medical charts, and had to write a giant letter explaining my situation. I had 12 months to get this done, but I procrastinated until the last second, because every time I sat down and opened the chart, I got overwhelmed with how horrible everything had become. 
This month I finally got it done. Dug through the chart, started to write my dispute letter. When I got to the portion about my most recent hospital stay, it floored me.

&amp;nbsp;

The day after I was admitted, the first comment from the psychiatrist (a doctor I've spent a lot of time with), was: "This patient is known to staff. Existing diagnosis of Bipolar 2 and Major depressive disorder, recurrent. Monitor, rule out Borderline Personality." 

&amp;nbsp;

A week later, she wrote "Diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder. We support previous diagnosis of Bipolar 2 and Major depressive (recurrent). Recommend continue to monitor."

&amp;nbsp;

But nobody told me this! Not the psychiatrist, not the nurses, not the social worker, not my family doctor! The chart was sent to my family doctor, I can see his name as the addressee. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel so betrayed. Why wouldn't they tell me? How am I supposed to get well, if I don't even know what's wrong? If you have diabetes they will tell you that. If you have cancer they will tell you that. Why is it okay to withhold information from the patient about their own diagnosis? I am SO ANGRY.

&amp;nbsp;

When I was diagnosed with Major depressive disorder, I didn't care. It has been obvious to me my entire life that something is WRONG. When they told me I had Bipolar disorder, I didn't care. I know some people who live with BP, and I know it's not the end of the world. But then I found out I've been diagnosed with BPD and yet nobody had the sense of decency to tell me? It knocked me on my ass. I feel like my foundation has been rocked.

&amp;nbsp;

After I found out, when I was able to stop freaking out, I did some reading. I checked out BPD blogs and forums. And hearing from other people who think like me was.... incredible. I would read some posts, and it was like reading pages from my own diary. I feel that knowing I have this mental health issue is important. It's validating. Knowing will help me be more proactive in my own care.

&amp;nbsp;

I made an appointment with a psychologist last week. He was very nice. But he thinks I need more help than he can give. Hearing that really hurt. He is trying to help me find a therapist who specializes in BPD, but nothing so far. Right now I feel like a volcano about to explode and I am terrified of my own anger.

I am getting a psychological evaluation soon and I am scared I will manipulate my psychologist into thinking I have BPD and he’ll diagnose me with it when I really don’t have it. I feel like I will discuss things in certain ways that allude to BPD due to me being very knowledgeable about the disorder and unintentionally taking on the label, which will lead to an improper diagnosis. I just don’t know how to act normally and be myself in this evaluation, I feel like a weird impostor who can fix their mental health in a second. Thanks and sorry for the scattered post

selftext: Of course traumatic experiences can be a cause, so this is not to say that everyone has physical issues if they have depression. BUT, the way that the DSM-V is classified is only diagnosing people with depression or other disorders based on symptoms, and these symptoms can easily be caused by more than just emotional trauma. Sadly, I think mental health professionals diagnose mental health disorders based on the DSM-V so it’s sort of like matching symptoms... 

I’ve learned recently that my thyroid may be to blame because I have hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune issues. I’ve had depression since I was a kid, and in the last five years of having physical discomfort on top of depression and anxiety, I was never able to be diagnosed by any conventional doctor and was just told that either I have to look into my anxiety or that I’m fine physically because they can’t find any problems and I don’t react well to the medication they prescribed. FIVE YEARS and more of running around almost feeling like I’m actually going crazy because doctors say “you’re fine” when you’re not. I was leaning towards the psychosomatic perspective but it just didn’t feel like it was helping me either. 
So essentially, it took someone with a functional medicine point of view to question whether if there’s something with my thyroids affecting me. And in functional medicine perspective, there are so many more reasons that can cause symptoms of depression and anxiety too, like heavy metal toxicity or an upset gut or deficiencies, etc. 
Therapy is always always helpful and I’ve been doing it too, but I think if you do feel a ton of fatigue and other things, maybe there’s something affecting you physically that can improve your emotions once it’s no longer affecting you! Worth a thought, I feel like. At least once you know physical issues are not the reason, you know getting emotional release from therapy will be the most helpful thing for you.

selftext: I’ve been diagnosed with literally everything. Previous doc said Schizoaffective and current one says Bipolar Type 1. They both agree on BPD, PTSD, and also ADHD. But they never want to talk about it with me. It’s always all about the Bipolar and/or the Schizoaffective. The most I’ve got out of them is that “ADHD will come later”. But that leaves me with many questions. I don’t know yet if what I feel is actually ADHD. 

I’m not hyperactive for one (ADD then?). But I’m perpetually spaced out. I can’t pay attention to anyone telling me anything for more than a few seconds. As a result I’ve spent my entire childhood and school years completely dissociated. 

I’m immensely forgetful. I’ll leave the house only to run back for keys. Make it back to my car and get on the road only to remember I forgot my wallet too. One of the reasons why I’m always late. Always. People call me to events early and I’m still late. 

I wake up every morning and I feel like I’m living on a separate timeline from the rest of the world. It’s like I have too little time to do too many things. There fore I give up and sit on the couch, put on some music, and watch the day and all of its priorities slide right by me. I can’t *start* activities unless I’m forced to by other people or if some one some how makes them more interesting for me. And no one believes me when I say *can’t*. It’s like a glitch in my programming. I keep hitting the start button but nothing happens. 

I’m always putting out fires. Everything I must do is stuff I should have already done. I have a massive pile of impossibly difficult tasks waiting to ruin my life. Primarily because I’ve procrastinated that hard. I’m further unable to touch this even bigger heap. 

My family doctor and psychiatrist have put me on 150mg Wellbutrin XL for the time being. I can say I’ve seen a difference as an anti depressant but nothing else. 

I’ve already been diagnosed with ADHD. I’m not asking for a diagnoses. I’m trying to relate. I’m really confused about why what everyone called “laziness” or “procrastination” is suddenly a symptom. Does what I’m experiencing sound like ADHD or ADD to you guys? I don’t know if I genuinely don’t believe I have this illness (too), or if I’ve been invalidated so much all my life that I can’t believe I’m sick. Insight is something I struggle with because of my strange relationship with reality because of the Schizoaffective or Bipolar...

Edit: since I’ve been down voted, please tell me why. I didn’t know I was doing anything wrong and I’d rather find out. You know? learn from my mistakes.

I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I got diagnosed and I started taking Zoloft. Zoloft made me feel like a zombie, so I was switched to Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin really helped improve my base mood, but I broke out in horrible hives a few weeks after starting it. After that I started Prozac, but it gave me terrible insomnia and actually worsened my depression. Soon after, I was diagnosed with OCD and BPD and my psychiatrist suggested Lexapro. I’ve been taking it for about a month now, and I believe it helps a lot with my general feeling of optimism, but over this past month I have been very depressed. Occasionally to the point where I can’t do anything. Honestly, I’m not sure if it has something to do with the Lexapro, or the fact that I was recently abandoned by my FP. I’m seeing my psychiatrist again next week and I’m not sure if I should ask to up my dosage. switch to something else, or add another medication to the Lexapro. I will also be starting therapy this month. 

Does anyone have any medication recommendations? Something that works for you?


TL;DR - Which meds work for you? Unfortunately, I struggle with BPD, OCD, anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. Lexapro isn’t cutting it and I want to talk with my psychiatrist about starting something new.

selftext: I was in a series of terrible times that lead to a traumatic event at the age of 17. I've just started officially going to therapy last year at 19 (I tried once at 17 but it didn't work out) and I'm 20 now. Throughout then, I've had one therapist and one physician suggest that I might have an anxiety disorder. My current therapist is suggesting something more serious is going on (PTSD) but I've never been officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist to receive any medication.

Talk therapy has helped my anxiety a lot but I just learned about splitting and... That's exactly what I've been doing every time I'm in an event that triggers me.  My therapist has never mentioned that term to me before either. I've been having suspicions about developing another mental disorder but I haven't done  enough research about it to mention it and I haven't brought this up with my therapist yet. 

QUESTIONS:
How serious should I be taking these suggestions?
How seriously should I be taking my suspicion? 
Is medication worth it? 
In your opinion is it worth getting checked out or am I just going to pay someone to give me a label? 
What are the benefits of getting a diagnosis? (ex. say that now that I'm diagnosed with something officially will my therapist go more in depth in our therapy sessions or would it remain the same?) 

I've looked into medication before but I didn't think it was that serious and I thought I could handle it... Now I'm starting to think otherwise.


Hope that's not too long. Thanks for any comments.

Edit: grammar

selftext: I always thought I did as a kid but it was never diagnosed and I always seemed to do well in high school so no one seemed to think anything of my inability to focus. Now I’m almost 30, and can’t seem to ever stay interested in anything for long. I can’t ever read more than a few pages of a book, want to be in one place or with anyone for too long without thinking about whats next, can’t seem stay at a job for too long, etc. luckily I’m a freelancer so I can bounce around frequently. 

Yesterday I was just venting to my therapist about how I’m at the best companies in my industry and still just cant ease my antsyness &amp; cant wait to gtfo and change the scenery. She asked me if I noticed that this is always the case with jobs after a short period &amp; if I had ever thought I could have ADD. This opened up a huge dialogue about habits from growing up and struggling through college with bad grades &amp; the inability to focus. I also have anxiety &amp; depression, insomnia and I constantly smoke weed to feel more calm. She mentioned having ADD would affect how I’m being treated for my depression and anxiety, what meds I should be on.

I will need to meet with my psychiatrist and have this conversation, but have any of you been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD as an adult &amp; have medications made it better, more stable? Thanks guys 🙏

**Weight:** 205

**Gender:** Female

**Smoking status:** Never a smoker

**Medical issues:** Hashimoto's, Undifferentiated Mixed Connective Tissue Disease

**Duration and location of complaint:** Finger joints (top, middle or base knuckle) and it happens sporadically.

Photos: I'm not sure if you'll be able to see it, but [here's a photo of a bump on my middle finger's middle joint.](https://imgur.com/a/2KsgRKb).  I put a circle around it because I feel like it's really difficult to even see via photo.

**Description:** I was diagnosed in 2016 with "Undifferentiated Mixed Connective Tissue Disease" after experiencing significant joint pain, mainly in the small joints of my hands and feet, but sometimes in my elbows, shoulders, knees and hips.  I had the AVISE test done after a positive ANA, CRP and Sed Rate but everything came back clear (tested for RA, Lupus, Sjorgrens) except for my thyroid antibodies (I had been diagnosed with Hashimoto's the year before, so no big surprise). I have been taking 200mg of Hydroxychloroquine 2 times per day ever since and have been super happy with the results... 99% or the time, I am pain-free and you can't really ask for anything better.

I've noticed that a handful of times over the last few months, my metacarpal joints will get really achy in the evening for no good reason (like overuse or something like that) and I made a connection that on those days, I have hard, red bumps that show up on my finger joints.  The bumps don't seem to have a rhyme or reason for where they appear... Today, I have one on my left hand's middle finger's middle joint.  The last time, it was on the middle joint of my right index finger.  The bumps are tender if you poke them or if something rubs against them (like holding a pencil or something) and they're slightly red (which I don't feel like you can see at all in the picture). They are hard and do not seem to be fluid filled and are often gone the next day, though sometimes they last a second day.

My first thought was that they were rheumatoid nodules, but I can't find anything anywhere that indicates that rheumatoid nodules can appear or disappear.

Like I said, 99% of the time I am pain-free, but I'm curious about what these bumps are and if I need to contact my rheumatologist for an appointment/more tests since I won't see him for another scheduled appointment until next February.

Thanks so much for your help!!

She has chronic cardiac problem like hypertonia and a month after the incident afterwards I was shocked her results from the heard doctor sad she has angina pectoris. back then I fell in a horrific deep depression because I decided, right there, on the double, that I have caused this condition. After this depression period I somehow managed to pull myself together up but for years I never forgot about this incident untill almost two years ago when it started haunting me again, so I posted the story in the AskDocs reddit and the people there incudling a physician explained to me  agina pectoris needs years and decades to develop, so my guilt trip is pointless and I need a therapist. Their explanation made me forget about this... but here I am again again I still recall, because it was a terrible thing to do, to pour your hot coffee during a verbal fight on your elder grandma, she was shocked and angry and stayed all day in bed for two days. So my OCD minds keep bugging me, tells me there still might be something between hear health and the incident, not to mention that it is an uncanny coincidence she was diagnosed with the angina a month after the coffee thing? She probably had it from before since she has cardiac problems since she was 10 and has hypertonia for decades, but still this coincidence is triggering the obsessive wondering on my guilt. Or my OCD goes like "well what if the stress by the coffee triggered her thyroid problems" as two years later she was diagnosed with low thyroid function. I have OCD and all the evidence in the world won't calm my mind. Also for these two years that I didnt feel guilty about her, the OCD changed into a fear of her death, no guilt, just the death, lbeing afraid of the pain I feel, or making me feel absurd feeling like f.e. there is no point to study for a career change or find a girlfriend since she is old and could die in ten years, but f.e. even next year...

I am on meds, and look for a good therapist. I feel desperate because I have struggled with OCD from since I was 12 and I am afraid I will not have a career, family and most of all hapiness due to it.

I was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I don't get to see him until next month.  Is there any reason for me to still be on carbamazepine?

selftext: I just want to write down a part of my story.

Over the years it has become increasingly difficult for me to share anything out of the ordinary with my friends or family.

I want to share this with my friends, but I find that I just can't at this moment, so I'm sharing it here.

When I was 7 years old I was diagnosed with ADHD and PDD\-NOS \(Autism\).

This never felt right to me, I wasn't like the other autistic people I have seen around me, I had social fears but I enjoyed social activities and I'm good at it.

And ADHD seems like a fad diagnosis in hindsight.

When I was around 15 years old I tried to take action and went back to the psychiatrist, asking for help.

He refused my request to see a psychologist and told me he wanted to put me on Ritalin, I had been given Ritalin several times when I was younger and it never turned out well, so I refused.

He plainly told me that if I refused Ritalin I was refusing treatment and he wouldn't help me further, so I accepted and started taking Ritalin again.

My response to taking Ritalin was so absolutely horrible that I can still only describe it as traumatic.

I had panic attacks throughout the entire day, every day, for at least three months.

My brain was racing , everything felt like it was attacking me, even things like trashcans and streetlights scared me.

My grip on reality was slipping, I was trying to anticipate everything everyone around me was thinking, constantly coming to extremely negative conclusions.

I started to worry about freak accident, maybe I would slip when holding a knife and I would land with my throat on the knife, pushing it far inside my throat.

Maybe the needle of the sowing machine my mother was using would hit something hard and the force of it would launch it towards my eye, lodging itself so deeply in there that they would have to take my eye out.

All of this with very graphic visuals that chilled me to the core.

After telling this to my psychiatrist he decided I needed anti\-psychotics, while staying on Ritalin.

He kept claiming the effects from the Ritalin would smooth out over time.

So I started taking Risperidone next to the Ritalin.

This pretty much only added more depression symptoms to the mix, I was completely lethargic, didn't want to do anything except hurt myself.

I didn't eat, barely slept, and was still in a constant state of absolute panic.

And suicidal, I have never been so calm in my life as when I was thinking about ending it back then.

The whole Ritalin and Risperidone ordeal ended when we had to call an ambulance for a heart attack scare.

About 8 years after that I went to a psychologist, who couldn't figure out how to help me.

I noted my anxiety quite often, but she swept it away, I was diagnosed with autism after all, that was the real problem.

After about 6 months I ended up quitting psychiatric help.

In the meantime, at age 32, my life is an absolute mess.

I haven't finished any sort of school, I don't have work, every couple years I start using hard drugs for a span of about 6 months since I was 17, ending in total disaster.

I can't maintain a romantic relationship, I keep my friends at arms length, just showing enough of my real self to be a pleasing person to be around.

My house is a mess and panic attacks are so frequent that I can't imagine a life without it.

This year I went back to a psychologist.

After a couple sessions she carefully asked me if I think my diagnosis is correct. I enthusiastically said no, that I was having a lot of trouble seeing why I would be autistic.

She told me she saw signs of OCD and OCPD.

\(At this point I really want to go into more of the symptoms that led to this, but even here I  find it too difficult to go into anything more specific than what I shared above.\)

It surprised me that I was actually having a discussion with my psychologist, we where going back and forth with ideas and observations, her telling me why she thought one or the other and me looking through the DSM\-5 and giving my feedback on what I did and did not agree on.

Which has led to an official re\-diagnosis, I have been re\-diagnosed with Obsessive\-compulsive disorder today.

selftext: Hi, I'm a woman, turning 29 tomorrow actually and I was only diagnosed with BPD around my mid\-27s. I had previously been struggling with what was thought to be depression and anxiety after a pretty severe episode of depression at the age of 17, when I also discovered drugs, which I have bave been abusing on and off since then. I never paid much attention in highschool, but it wasn't problematic enough for me to fail/be held back/cause trouble. My interpersonal relationships with friends and at home was what caused me the most anguish.

Younger than that, in grade school, I certainly had a conduct disorder, I don't know what it would've been called in the early 90s versus today, or if I just wou'dve been given ritalin and been done with it, but I had a deep aversion for authority despite being "three apples tall" \(can you say that in English lol? Sorry, first language is French\)

As I used to mention on here at times on my older accounts \( I had to remake\), I found that initially, the diagnostic felt a bit like a double\-edge sword. In one sense, it finally answered the 20\+ decades old question I had been constantly thinking about, that is "What the HELL is wrong with me!?" 

On the other hand, I found it dififcult not to blame every behaviour and mishaps on BPD that kept happening with my BF, with my friends etc, initially, until it got to the point where I got called out for it, receiving the whole "you are not your disorder" speech, and "it doesn't excuse every shitty decision or action that you take, nor does it make it that you "can't help it". I struggled with that, because logically I understood, but at the same time, I had heard so often that BPD was caused by invalidation in childhood, and wasn't this exactly what my loved ones were doing? Now I realize that they weren't, but at the time, it was really hard to untangle and it took a few months \(still trip on a knot once in a while too.\) 

The concept of emotional, rational and mindful mind was still unknown to me at the time, so I wouldn't have been able to explain it exactly this way, but after a few months of DBT, I think I can easily say that my rational mind \*did\* understand where people were coming from, but that my high\-intensity emotions were still grasping for a reason to be allowed to exist, even if it was a bad, toxic one.

I've started seeing a psychiatrist \(not often, about once every 3 months but I'm pretty stable and relatively functional, work a 9 to 5 etc so it's enough I think\) since last fall and have been in DBT every 1\-2\-3 weeks since February, and it's really helped me grow. Not perfectly, not at the speed I'd like to, but it's still really helping. 

I saw many counscelors, doctors and therapists through my late teens and my 20s. My GP for my depression, the psychiatrist he refered me to for suicidal ideation, a councelor in college that I admit I talked more about ADHD with than BPD because I wanted adderall at the time...another psychologist at university, at least two more doctors on campus, then some at the ER. I don't understand how nobody ever caught this? Heck, \*I\* should've caught it. I read the symptoms back when I was much younger, and I thought that it did sound like me, but I figured I wasn't sick enough, that I didn't know what I was talking about. 

This turned pretty long and kind of too much into my personal history as those kind of posts tend to do when I write them, but basically, I always wonder how things could have been different if I had been diagnosed at 14, 16, 19, 21? Would I be a much happier, healthier adult now? Would I be "normal" and owning a house and having children and a car and a dog and everything instead of living day\-to\-day, followingmy hedonistic and childlike cravings?

I'd like for people who were diagnosed both late and early \(and your age/circa what era too since psychology and psychiatry evolved fast in the last few years\) to maybe discuss this and tell me what they think about it.

Thank you and have a nice day everyone! Sorry if I've made typos, gotta run to work, no time to edit.

selftext: I was going through my moms file cabinet when I found a report from 7 years ago from when my parents took me to a psychologist. That was when I was around 15. I had cut off all my friends and sat inside playing video games all day so my parents started making me go to a counselor who then had me see a psychologist once.

My parents never completely told me what they were looking for. According to the report, it turns out they were trying to diagnose me with Asperger's! Alas, I proved to not be on the autistic spectrum. The report said that what was ACTUALLY wrong with me was that I had depression, stemming from years of living under the crushing weight of a broken marriage, plus my dads drinking problem, and subsequently my failing 
 relationship with him. Personally though I think it was mostly caused by my failure with the opposite sex.

So, what did my parents do when their 15 year old son was diagnosed with depression? Nothing. They never even talked to me about it, not even my mom who suffered from postpartum depression at one point. They couldn't be bothered to take me to the counselor anymore. 

To this day, my life is still fucked up. I have no motivation and no will to live. I'm going to die alone.

He's known about ny bipolar disorder since we were friends, but really saw it for the first time in February. I had a massive manic episode due to my psych constantly cancelling appts. after taking me off a stable dose. I kept getting impulsive thoughts to leave him and my mind was telling me I didn't love him and that something wasn't right (mind you I was head iver heels the day before and in the middle of signing a lease together). I never told him what I was freaking out about. All he saw was me crying nonstop, retreating to my room, and running away to call my dad for an hour to cry. I didn't tell him because I didn't want to hurt him and cause him stress, but I felt him seeing all of this without context for a whole month was also awful for him. As SOs of bipolar people, what would ypu suggest I do in case this happens again? Do I tell him or do I keep him in the dark again?

Traveling for nearly 9 hours to get to our vacation spot, 2 weeks staying their, and another 9 hours back. I don't want to lie to him but does anyone have any advice on a good way to keep him from wanting to go with his family? I wouldn't mind just he and I going somewhere but the family (especially his sister) is a pain. I've tried talking to him about it but it absolutely does not work, at one point he was begging me to go and in tears over it (I won't sugarcoat it, he's been diagnosed with a bit of retardation), I can't just "talk to him" about it without him becoming angry and moody. Honestly I'd probably have to break a bone and go to the hospital to get out of going without him pitching a fit. Does anyone have any advice on how I could get out of it along with getting him to accept a vacation on our own?

selftext: So I’ve fallen back into my depression after a heated argument. Every time I get super depressed I have this urge to just cut myself. I don’t know why. I don’t do it for attention. Paper cuts gives me to chicken skins yet when I get super depressed I want to cut myself with something sharp. It feels great. I feel no pain. I been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADD. Been doing well these couple of years while on meds. Lately I feel my anxiety is getting worst now that I’m back in school. My meds aren’t helping. Maybe I need a higher dosage? I hate having to take meds though. Why can’t I be normal and happy like most people that I know. 

Also to add to my depression I’m a asian, short and fat. Obese. At least it’s what the scale says even though my fat is pretty evenly distributed around my body so no one can really tell my actual weight. 

I really don’t know what more else to say.  Depression sucks.

I am not even able to enjoy the mediums of entertainment that i used too and especially music doesn't give me any sensation anymore like it's just all sound beating in my ear. 
Been a few years since I don't like to socialize, like even if there is a day that none of my friends came to school but i don't really care and never get bothered about that.
If u have not been living under a rock, you should know that 'Infinity war' has released but i don't have a will to watch it although i used to be a big fan of marvel.
Though i have been diagnosed and received medication(which i don't take anymore.
Also my life has been more or less traumatic since my childhood even uptill last month which has made me more or less numb. 
Also I'm just 16,and all i want to know is that there's a way to cope up with this? Should I take counseling?

selftext: I'm turning 28 in a few weeks. I was 17 when I started smoking cigarettes and I quit smoking cigarettes at 23. It was also at 23 that I started smoking weed daily.

I've tried to quit weed twice in the last 3 years. The first time I had quit for 5 months and the second time I had quit for 7 months. I haven't smoked since April 19th as I decided that 4/20 was a good day to quit.

This round of withdrawal symptoms has been the worst, but I've done it before so I can do it again. Weed had literally been making me sick within minutes of smoking. I was diagnosed with acid reflux about 6 months ago and within 10 mins of smoking my acid reflux symptoms flare up. Due to this, its just not worth it anymore.
I'm hoping to continue posting here to keep myself accountable.
Symptoms currently include: interrupted sleep, daily headaches, irritability and depressive episodes. It will be two weeks tomorrow so it can only get better from here.

So I took matters into my own hands. I have found that Coffee and Nicotine help me focus, but nicotine pods are pricy, and I am out of a job. Today, I quit them \(because I have no $, no lectures about that they help...\) and I just can't focus. I literally can't follow an entire conversation the whole way and I was driving and almost got killed two times because I was distracted. Actually a car started following me after I accidentally cut them off and I had to call the cops... :\( and my parents told me I'm acting like I'm on something because I just can't focus or follow through a whole conversation.... Anyways, I was wondering what you all do to help your ADHD when driving, and how you all can keep a conversation. I am a very loud person and just kept doing random shit and interrupting people today. Thanks!

selftext: I've been so depressed for a couple of months. I've tried changing cities and even visiting different states to let go off my thoughts. I've been diagnosed with DSPD (there's a sub) which mean I can't function during early morning but sleep all day and stay up all night. I couldn't finish college in 7 years.

Coming back to video gaming, I finally decided to put an end to this addiction last year in exchange of partying out, drugs and booze. I always felt something had missing in my life despite having everything. I just picked up an Xbox One X and now it feels like getting my early life back! Never give something that you've loved your entire life. I've convinced myself that the job I have is enough to pay my rent, gaming car expenses and there's no reason to be sad about anything at all. I also broke up with someone I loved so much that I was contemplating jumping off her balcony that day.

Trust me, if you do not have a reason to spend money on to, you will never enjoy working. 

Here's my tiny share of thoughts

selftext: Hi. This is going to be a long post. Please bear with me.
I'm a 17 y/o female, and I have BPD, Mania, severe depression, bipolar traits, and DID traits  (as has been diagnosed so far). 
I have been in a relationship with a wonderful, supportive,and understanding guy for the past few months. The problem is, he's been on the recieving end of many of my manic episodes ,identity crises ,phases,splittings etc. They always took a toll on him but he wanted to stick with me even then,even after I told him I'd understand if needed to get away from the mess that was me.
But everything went awry when I went through some seriously triggering stuff which made me not only seriously contemplate suicide (that's common enough with me) but also made me dissociate and tell my boyfriend in straight and direct terms that I'm gonna kill myself soon. And in a terrifying and honestly crazy way. He was totally freaked and panicked. He couldn't sleep he couldn't focus on anything... which made him (unsurprisingly) demand a break. For at least a week. And I, not knowing what to do, gave in. And I'm miserable. I feel lost. What do I do?

selftext: Backstory\- There literally is not a psychiatrist around where I live, so my therapist told me I had to just go to a doctor \(without a referral\), and I'm nervous about the whole thing.

I don't know if a lot of other people have gone through this \(I don't know the doctor, and don't have a doctor\), but I'm anxious. I want to talk to the doctor about my symptoms, but I don't know if that;s appropriate, since shes not there to diagnose me, and I don't know if shes going to understand enough about my psychiatric needs to even care or understand them. 

And then additionally, since im going to a regular doctor, I'm afraid of what if she doesnt a good handle on what I should be taking, or how to adjust if theres problems \(obviously less and more shouldn't be a struggle, but if shes not a mental healthy person then if I have some random issue, will she know that one thing does this to this type of person but another thing does that???\). 

I guess I'm mostly just seeking solidarity here. Living in a small town presents challenges I never knew could exist and I feel alone.

selftext: Hey all, throw away account here. 

I’ve recently moved to New York and have become a lot more anxious. And when I’m anxious I have to pee. And when I have to pee I get anxious about potentially peeing myself and then I just get more anxious about that, and it’s an endless cycle. 

I’ve never peed myself, aside from when I was a child, so I’m not sure how I’ve developed this sort of irrational fear. It’s annoying especially when I’m on the train because I’ll have to run off and find a public bathroom which, for those of you who don’t live here, is extremely difficult. This only perpetuates the problem. 

It can happen sometimes while at work, or out with friends. Where I sometimes find myself literally running to the bathroom, and eventually go, and it ends up being a lot less than I was anticipating. 

I’m asking for advice on how to knock this behavior because it’s something that’s just started since I’ve moved here, and I’ve not been diagnosed with anxiety or anything like that. It just feels like extreme nerves.

selftext: I live with my girlfriend and we're in university. She was diagnosed with ADHD and has benefited a lot from treatments and strategies for ADHD people since then. She's even been able to excel in a very difficult program at school. School has a very definitive start and end time as well as clear goals so I think that's partly why it's been going so well for her. But now that schools over its been hard to keep the days on track. There's just been a super irregular schedule with super late bedtimes, late wake up times, lots of video games, etc. She's been complaining herself about how there's no structure for her anymore which I know is essential. She feels like there's no real point to doing a lot of stuff, that motivation is just kind of fading away and I believe the lack of structure is the main cause.

TLDR: How do I help her establish some sort of structure and motivate her when there really isnt any that absolutely "has to get done" like getting to school on time?

selftext: It’s been a year since I it happened to me (was sexually assaulted and indecently assaulted many times over a week because I thought I wasn’t able to get away from them) and whilst I have been having intrusive thoughts almost daily since it happened (and have been diagnosed with PTSD by two psychologists, and am still seeing one) last night I think I had my first full blown panic attack.

I have had similar experiences before but never ones where I truly found myself struggling to breath, very elevated heart rate, arms and legs shaking, etc.

It happened when I was looking at the person who assaulted me’s social media to see who was following them. I discovered that my best friend (who knows it happened but doesn’t know who, although they could easily work it out if they thought about it based on info I’ve told them) was following them on Instagram. 

I know it’s something little to get fussed but it was such a terrifying experience. I’m wondering if people have coping mechanisms or things they do when these things happen to them?

selftext: I've suspected I have bpd for awhile, even though I was diagnosed with bipolar. After 2 months in a partial hospital program, and 2 weeks inpatient, my psychiatrist confirmed he believes its bpd.  I've done a lot of research on bpd. A lot of it talks about ignoring the behavior of bpd's. That the self harm and suicidality is just for attention. I don't mean it to be. I have a boyfriend who is very supportive. He literally bandages me when I hurt myself. He tries so hard to help me. Now I realize I have done it all for attention, and I feel so bad about it. How can I make up for it? I didn't mean to do it. And I'm really sorry. How can I make him ignore me so it doesn't feed in to my behavior? I am so worthless. I am so sorry.

Edit: I know how offensive this post must seem. I mean to pass no judgement on anyone else. This is just how I feel right now. Please don't downvote. I can't handle that right now. I know you are not bad, I just feel this way about me.

selftext: So, back when i was six i had been diagnosed with adhd, i refused to take my meds because it was hard to swallow even though it was small, and didnt effect me anyways. I was an outcast because i was so annoying and I had few friends, second grade I had friends for a few years but due to being in class together. Then fifth grade and sixth i was an outcast again, 7th and 8th it seemed like i had friends but it didnt seem real. Now im 17, in 11th grade and i know im not taken seriously nor am i liked. Some people are friends though. But like im never invited anywhere, im always at home afterschool doing nothing. Feeling left out and lonely. And it means i cant really relate to happenings. And i doubt ill make friends in college because ill probably just be an outcast there due to ADHD and i just doubt ill ever even find a girlfriend. I wish i could have friends but no one does. Tell me, did you experience this ever but manage to make friends in college.

selftext: I am currently in university and was sexually assaulted just over a year ago. I was diagnosed with PTSD by my psychologist about 2 months ago but have been experiencing the 'symptoms' ever since the assault. I see a counsellor provided by the university about once a month. I find the sessions helpful, however since our meetings are spaced apart I feel like I'm not getting much better. I wouldn't mind meeting more but don't know if it would be okay to ask.

Ever since the 'anniversary' of the assault \(about 2 weeks ago\) I have been struggling to do any of my class work, I've left assignments to the last minute and haven't started any of my things due in the future. I was never like this all through high school before the assault, and have been a bit worse since the assault but it's never been this bad.

The university always offers to give me extensions but really, I don't want them. I want to be able to work within the normal deadlines like I used to do. Does anyone one else have any tricks or techniques they do when you find yourself in similar situations?

Thank you :\)

selftext: Hello, I’m a Caucasian, 20 year old male. 6 foot, 185 lbs. and on November 17, 2017 I severely sprained my ankle playing basketball. I was diagnosed with a severe high ankle sprain after multiple x-rays and a MRI. I was put in a boot and crutches for about 2 months until  I could bear weight on it again, and went to physical therapy for about a month and continuously RICE’d my ankle. It has been over 7 months now and my ankle is still swollen, and I get a sharp pain in the bottom of my tibia (I think? The pointy bone that faces inward where the calf meets the foot). I can usually walk with no pain but I cannot run without what feels like a sharp knife jabbing at my ankle. I continue to rice my ankle and do some of my physical therapy exercises when my ankle feels sore but I feel like my ankle should be %100 by now. I do plan on seeing a doctor soon but any advice/tips are appreciated.

I'm diagnosed with major depression and when I have episodes I sleep for like 16 hours a day. I do feel depressed and stressed lately but not particularly like not sure I'm completely in an episode but I am SO exhausted. I keep having these mood/mind swings I dont really act out or anything, but one second I will feel REALLY motivated and like everything is ok in life and LITERALLY 2 seconds later not exaggerating I will just be all "oh its not worth it like im too tired its too much fuck it it wont work out" What is going on with me? Why am I so incredibly tired and having those weird swings? 

Just important info, Im on these medications that are supposed to keep you incredibly awake which would make any normal person totally jump off the walls but I just sleep:

I notice whenever I take it, colors become darker, I feel no difference except that I feel wired. I am able to concentrate for a while but then it fades, I was on ritalin (5mg) x2 a day for a month, while it made me feel slow and lethargic, I preferred it to this, I feel too wired on adderall, I can actually sit down and read on ritalin. Is there something wrong with me? I work from home also and notice I am feeling pretty depressed, lose my temper easily because I feel lonely. 
I am worried that I actually do not have adhd, that I am lying to myself. I cannot focus without meds, I lose things constantly, I misplace my keys, wallet, important documents. I studied math for 3 weeks and forgot everything after I started reviewing it. I am right now coming down from my adderall (10mg) pill. blue. I feel like I am too wired to focus and I feel like a imposter.

selftext: Long story short, I gained a lot of weight rapidly recently and was diagnosed with PCOS, and I highly suspect my risperidone is not helping things at all.  My risperidone works *great* and has me more mentally healthy than I've been in years, but I don't want to be on any meds that make the weight gain/retention any worse.  

I'm not quite sure what to do.  Do I try a different med that might not work as well in an attempt to shed some of the weight, or do I just deal with it and stay on the risperidone for the sake of my mental health?  The weight gain has me *very* upset as someone with major body issues so I'd really like to try to lose some, but I don't want to risk having any more episodes.

Are there any good meds that **don't** cause weight gain, or that could even result in some weight **loss**?  Should I risk changing meds to lose weight or should I just stick with the ones that work and be miserable about how my body looks?

Would really love opinions and insight.

A few years ago I had a verbal fight with my gran and after she insulted me i splashed her with my hot coffee. She was really surprised fell back on the couch, but then stood up quickly cleaned up the mess then went to the basement to re-arrange stuff in order to canalize her anger into something then laid in her bed for the day and the next day. mainly laid in bed and was feeling naseous.

It must be my OCD but my mind keeps digging whether I did something to her health. A year later she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and only a month after the coffee incident with angina pectoris. Two years ago I posted a post here asking about any relation between the coffee incident and the angina pectoris. A physician explained to me there is no relation between the two so explained to me how angina pectoris develops. By my mind still digs wether this incident somehow caused something to my grandmother's health, f.e. the thyroid problems or god knows what else.

Around 5 am today , I woke up drenched in sweat and screaming in pain for almost an hour.  The pain was worse than childbirth or an episiotomy or pancreatitis.  I have been having intermittent sharp fleeting pains in the same area for several days prior to this.


I am still in pain, but it is manageable.  What do you think it is and should I go to the hospital at this point?  Or is it too late and/or pointless now since the pain isn't as
severe?  If the really severe pain returns in the next few days, should I go to the e.r.? I just really don't want to waste e.r. resources or get stuck with another $10,000 hospital bill.  



My closest hospital does not accept medi-cal and I have no way to get there other than an ambulance and no way to get home ,other than a cab that I don't have $ for. Thanks so very much for your help and time.

selftext: I’m 22 and was diagnosed with bronchitis this morning through LiveMD. 

The doctor listened to my breathing and heard my symptoms, and looked at the nasty phlegm I cough up and said it sounds/looks like bronchitis. 

I was given: 
- 500mg amoxicillin 3x daily
- 4mg medrol pack
- albuterol 
- I’m also going to begin mucinex DM max strength 

I was looking up my condition online and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if it was a mild case of pneumonia and I’m paranoid. *i did have asthma as a kid but it hasn’t effected me in roughly 10 years* 

Symptoms 
- cough lasting ~ 1 week 
- started out with clear phlegm and has progressed to a dry cough with bouts of THICK brown phlegm. 
- wheezing
- chest pain (muscle related)
- chest tightness 
- headache (I’d assume from coughing almost non stop) 
- I believe I had a mild fever through the night. I woke up sweating. 
- weak/no energy 
- no appetite 

Would the treatment I’m currently on cover both conditions?  I will obviously keep a close eye on myself and will see my PCP next week if I do not improve.

selftext: Okay. I just...let's just start from the beginning.

For about two years now, I've just felt so tired I can barely deal. This past school year, however, has been especially bad for me. I lost any energy I had, I lost any motivation I had. I haven't had a 'motivation day' in almost a year now. For a few months, I felt totally numb. I still feel numb, but now I'm back to being able to start bawling over something I don't necessarily care about. 

Sometimes I think I'm faking it. Sometimes, I miss the numbness and inability to cry. Sometimes I want the complete numbness back. Sometimes I just...don't want to get better, and I hate myself for it. 

I hate how I say I have depression but it's not diagnosed and I can still laugh and have at least some feelings at times. I hate how I still say I have depression when it's not confirmed. I hate how I kind of want this still. I hate how I think I'm just using depression as an excuse for me flunking out of school and being a lazy ass who can't do anything right.

I work a job that I really don't like but I don't know what to do. I feel comfortable here and I'm late every day (10 minutes or so) and no says anything and some people know about my problems.

I don't want to work full time anymore because I don't agree with spending most of my life working and money doesn't motivate me at all (except needing it to live ofc) I'd like a part time job but I can't find one and I don't know what I want to do. Working full time really takes it out of me, after work I usually do nothing or procrastinate because I'm so mentally drained from being there.

I don't really know what I'm asking for. Has anyone been in a similar position and found a way out? Or does anyone have any advice on how I can get a better outlook on things and make work seem more worthwhile? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

She prescribed me clonazepan 0.5mg, escitalopram 10mg, and laminine (a supplement), and told me I should take all of them tonight. Any side effects I should look out for? My doctor said I should be fine and people take these meds and could still go to work, etc.

Also I'm going out tomorrow morning, sourcing school supplies with my friend and her kids. We've been planning this trip for months. Do you recommend going out immediately after taking meds?

Edit: Also, 3 meds in 1 night, is it too much? I also forgot to clarify to my doctor that I'm still getting anti-rabies shots. Any ill effects?

Edit 2: I'm researching about the laminine supplement and I found out that they sell these at MLM things. I mean we've tried some successful supplements in the family and they might help, but now, can't help thinking how shady my doctor kinda is (don't worry, she didn't make me sell them lol). Still afraid to take it because I can't rule this out with the rabies vaccine.

 I turned 18 last december and I always said that as soon as I turned 18 I would donate blood and keep doing it as often as I could. 

This semester, there was always a blood donating point in front of my University almost everyday so I decided I would do it... But they told me I can't do it because of the meds I take. I was so disappointed and sad, and it haunted me every time I passed in front of my University and they were there, and no one was donating and I WANTED and I COULDN'T.  

Now, tho this has made me real sad, it has encouraged me to beat depression in the ass so I can stop taking meds and finally donate blood. My goal used to be to donate blood when I turned eighteen, but now it is to donate blood when I beat depression, and I hope you all can find a reason that motivates you enough to fight for it.

That was really all I wanted to say.

So anyway, I feel like I dissociate sometimes(?) but I dont know a ton about it, so I has hoping someone  could give me some insight.

Sometimes I almost like im dizzy, but I dont wanna fall over. Like my eyes wont really focus on the things around me. I feel like nothing is quite the same as it was before, that Im in a parallel universe where everything is just a little off. I kinda feel like that what ever I do wont really make a difference because Im not actually in the same world as before. I dont feel out of body and like im watching my life as. 3rd person like many say they feel. I feel like I mentioned before, im in a parallel universe and Ive taken over the body of my other self. I know its me, but It also feel wrong and as though its not actually me. Hopefully this makes sense to someone

They were lovely! The lady on the phone asked me when I was diagnosed, how I manage it, and which medication I am on.

 I was honest, and emphasised I have never missed a deadline or a day at work because of bipolar, and that I work full time in retail in a stressful environment and I am doing well. I haven’t had a full episode in over two years and I haven’t self harmed for over two years as well. 


 She declared me fit to work, and apparently the only thing my new employer will see is that I have a long term health condition, managed with medication, which is covered under the Equalities Act 2010. 

Fit to work! I think that’s the last hoop to jump through. I don’t have a start date yet but I am excited! 

Thanks everyone for all your advice. I am glad I was honest, but I am in the UK so I don’t know how well honesty would be received in other countries.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD-C and OCD, yet I feel like I have to live up to my symptoms now and then because sometimes I really notice anything.
I have difficulty paying attention yet I have an amazing memory, I am hyperactive and sometimes I lose my path yet I am very responsible and loyal. I pay a lot of attention to detail to the point of being perfectionistic yet I can rationalize when I need to stop myself.
This has been happening a lot lately and I can’t say is a bad thing at all. I feel less anxious and less stressed and like I don’t need to justify myself as much, yet I don’t feel cured. I am still distracted, I still have intrusive thoughts, I am still highly sensitive...
I am very confused. 
I have been going to therapy and taking my medicine regularly. Am I getting better? And if that’s so, why do I still feel paranoid like I have something worse lurking in my mind? Like I will never be stable? If I indeed feel better, why am I afraid?

selftext: Hi

I'm a 22 years old healthy male. I'm 183cm and weight around 75kg. I neither smoke, drink or take any medications. I have no medical history. 

A month ago a dermatologist on here diagnosed my tiny red spots as Cherry Angioma. It eased my mind, but when I read about them they should first start to appear at the age of 30 and increase in numbers from there. If you get many of them, there could be an underlying diease. 

If there were an underlying diease, would I have more than this?

I have two on my right hand

4\-6 on both arms on the outside of the biceps \(same size of a needle\-tip\)

2 on my stomach and one on my leg. 

The biggest one is probably around 0.1cm, but they're bright red, so easily noticed.

A few pictures.

They're all almost flat/smooth. Some slight bumps on few of them. I know this probably is a bit hypochondriac, but I just feel I get many of "something" you should only see your first off in your thirties.

I've had hives in the past but always the raised patches. These are raised bumps and rash like patches on my arms and legs and sometimes back. I switched back to my regular detergent. They are extremely itchy and sometimes painful (sharp pains). I am very tired, possible from lack of sleep from being so uncomfortable. 

So...I guess I need advice. Let it try and go away or seek assistance from primary ?

selftext: My current crappy ACA-Marketplace Insurance does not cover any psychiatrists in my area, so I researched GPs that treat ADD on ZocDoc and thankfully was able to find one.

I was wondering if I should state that as my reason for setting an appointment (in the form) or if I should just set it as a "general consultation". I am concerned that if I am forthright about it that they will just assume that I am just trying to score some Adderall and make it difficult for me.

On the other hand, I am concerned that if I just schedule it as a general consultation, that the doctor will not be prepared to prescribe me medicine or that they will waste too much time with general diagnoses and ask me to come in another time.

Alternatively, I could schedule it as a General Consultation, and briefly explain the real reason in the "notes for the doctor's office" section.

What do you all think?

For some background, I was living abroad for a long time and was diagnosed and on medication for several years, but have not been on medication for a while now. Things have started to go downhill in terms of my executive function and it has really started to affect my life (lost job, relationship problems, etc.), so I think I'm going to have to get on medication again.

I would prefer to go to a psychiatrist, but unfortunately, I can't really afford to pay out of pocket at the moment, so this seems to be the best option for me.

My other concern is that he would make me go to psychologists to get a formal diagnoses, since I don't have any proof from the past and it was abroad, so no US medical records or anything.

Any recommendations would be highly appreciated! 

Thank you.

selftext: Hello all! I am new here.

I wanted to reach out to you all, as I have suspected \(and my husband has\) that I may be on the ASD spectrum, but I am also not entirely certain. I never thought of it being a possibility for ASD, but I have always struggled with pretty bad social anxiety \(diagnosed\), ADD \(diagnosed\), and OCD \(self diagnosed\), and depression \(diagnosed\). 

I haven't been to a therapist/psychologist in a long while now, but I am currently taking Xanax for my anxiety and Wellbutrin for my depression. The Xanax seems to help a lot with my social anxiety, as I work in a call center and I have to "be on my game" every day talking to people \(which I detest\), and I have been able to kind of switch on and off for a while now so I don't have panic attacks as much. What I mean by this is I am able to function enough to hold down a job, and do my job etc, but it is very, very draining because I have to "pretend". 

There are days where I feel I am nailing it, I feel like I am acting normal, can carry on normal conversations without going off on tangents about unrelated stuff etc which I tend to do a lot when I am "not on my game". I'll go off on tangents about whatever pops into my mind and I can tell other people get a little confused but go along with it to be nice haha.

My husband says I rock back and forth a lot and REALLY knows about when I go off on tangents/can't focus. I even took the test Aspie Quiz located here: [http://rdos.net/eng/Aspie\-quiz.php](http://rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php) and my results were:

Your neurodiverse \(Aspie\) score: 147 of 200 

Your neurotypical \(non\-autistic\) score: 56 of 200 

You are very likely neurodiverse \(Aspie\) 

I guess what I am trying to say here, is that I am not really sure how to go about this. I have looked into an ASD specialist in my area, there aren't many in my area it seems, but I am honestly nervous of going, too. How did you all go about being diagnosed? Should I just go see a regular therapist or psychologist first and be referred to someone?

Sorry for the rambling \(I do this best haha\)! Thank you all in advance :\)

selftext: Age: 19,
Weight: (guessing about 125 pounds),
Height: 5'8,
Gender: Male,
Canada,
Caucasian ,
Diagnosed with ADHD when I was 11 (Although I know I've had it all my life),
No current meds

About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD, and I took medication for it for a while. I stopped taking it because it made me moody and ruined my appetite, I actually lost some weight because of it.

Along with having to deal with the normal symptoms of ADD every day, here are a few other things that appear to be separate from that. 

Social situations with people who aren't close friends are really awkward. Things like, not knowing how to respond to people or continue a conversation (I respond to most things with a quiet laugh or smile), not making eye contact, and not remembering what the person said after they leave. Starting conversations is also really challenging. I usually go over in my head what I will say to the person before I go and do it, so I don't make myself look stupid. Even thinking about doing oral presentations in my future university English classes makes me sick. 

I also can have a bit of a temper. I enjoy playing computer games and I get very competitive and angry at times playing them. I've smashed my desk and screamed at the screen countless times. 

Another thing is my interests. I really only have two: Computers and Cars. Not many things interest me. I even had many opportunities to join sports teams or other extra curricular activities as a kid, but nothing ever interested me enough to participate.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated :)

I am 20yo male and about four months ago I couldn’t handle my situation anymore so I visited psychiatrist for the first time. I told him about my problems and he diagnosed me ADHD. I wasn’t suprised as much, because I read some articles about ADHD on the internet before the visit and it quite correspondet with me. I was really happy that I finally find the answer for my problems and I got official diagnose from the doctor. At that moment everything makes sense, I found the reason why I wasn’t succesfull in life the whole time. That was good moment and I hoped that from this moment it will be just better and better.. it looks I hoped in vain. 

Nothing improved and It’s even worse, looks like medication isn’t working at all.. It is so frustrating when you see how others have succesfull life, how they have zest for life, how they are motivated and how they are able to reach their dreams. It seems that I am stuck and I don’t know how to get from these shit. I have mood swings whole day, so there are moments when I don’t feel as bad and I am just sad about my situation, but when the bad mood comes I don’t know what to do, It’s very intense and I am thinking about the worst.. These moments usually end by using xanax.

selftext: So, the history: When I was a child, I was diagnosed with ADHD (as well as PDD, but that's not really relevant here, I guess). Sadly, my stepmother felt that I shouldn't be on any sort of medication so I was quickly taken off Ritalin and had to continue going through school completely unmedicated. Fortunately I was a smart kid, so I was able to make it through school and graduate with pretty good grades.

Unfortunately, when it was time to go to college and live in a dorm, I pretty much fell apart. That's well in the past now, but is a thing that happened, I guess.

Now, I'm in my 30's, I work a retail job that I actually like. I've been there for a few years now, and I have really good insurance through it. I feel that I would strongly benefit from seeing a psychiatrist or someone else similar who specializes in ADHD so that I could get a lot more focus in my life. I have a hard time with focus, patience, organization, as well as just having this feeling that I could be doing a lot more with my life at home as well as at work if I could only rein in my brain.

Though my insurance's website (United Healthcare), I am able to find doctors who specialize in ADHD, so the thing that I am really wondering here is how exactly do I approach one of them about getting an appointment and finally getting the help that I actually need?




**tl;dr**: Diagnosed with ADHD as a child, frustrated at self as an adult and wondering how to properly approach a professional to get the help that I need.

selftext: Tw: abuse and suicide mention (to be safe)


Im sorry, this is going to end up being a venting/ramble post, but i dont have anyone i can really talk to about this and will understand where im coming from.

I was diagnosed with adhd in 2nd grade and was put on ritalin. Ritalin worked, but it made me feel like a zombie. Fast forward to 10th grade and my doc decides to switch me to concerta so i wont have to take a second dose at lunch time. 

Concerta did not do well with me. I was already depressed and suicidal because i lived in a very abusive household and the concerta just amplified it alot. I stopped taking it after trying to od on meds, and just stopped taking meds all together. I never really understood what adhd was or how it worked and thought i just needed to try harder and if i couldnt it just meant i was a failure. This was also back in early 2000's in the early days of the internet so its not like i could google it easily. So i had the wonderful joy of living majority of my life thinking i was a complete and utter failure as a human being that didnt deserve to exist.

Spent the rest of highschool and college passing with B's, but just barely and constantly pulling all nighters to finish work.

Fast forward to this past december when my daughter was diagnosed with adhd as well. Start trying to learn more so i can help her and basically realize that everything in my life has been affected by my adhd, which explains alot.

Decide to go back on meds but want to avoid ritalin and concerta if possible. Already take welbutrin xl for my depression so we started with strattera at 40mg. Was doing better but still not at the level of a functioning human being. Up it to 80mg and started to have a lot of problems with side effects. Switched to aderall 10mg because of it but the only thing thats done is raise my blood pressure and cause chest pain. 

So now we are trying low dose of welbutrin xl, zoloft and strattera to see how that works. But my husband doesnt like the idea of mixing to types of antidepressants like that. Still going to trust my doc and try it, but he's still going to be upset about it. Im just desperate to find anything that will help because ontop of making life harder, its been putting a strain on our marriage, even more so now that our oldest is showing more and more signs of her adhd. He tries to understand but doesn't quite get it since he doesnt have it, which makes it frustrating.

I know it takes a long time and many tries to find the right meds and dose, i just feel lost atm and dont know what to do besides just trust my doc, but ive had a bad history with doctors  fucking shit up so its making me worried.


TL;DR 

Despite being diagnosed over 20 years ago i didnt understand how much adhd impacted my life. Its putting a strain on my marriage, trying to find meds that wont make me super sick, and i just really need a hug right now because i feel like im going to break down crying any moment now

selftext: **tl;dr** My family doesn't understand, thinks I'm just lazy, that meds don't help. I want to cry because being diagnosed made myself make sense. My family makes me wonder what if I'm actually wrong. 

I've been arguing with my mom, my sister, and my aunt, for so many months about taking medication for my ADHD. They don't believe I need it or that I even have it. It makes me so frustrated and at the same time anxious because what if they're right.

I was diagnosed with ADHD August of last year. I was reluctant to believe it at first too because I had come in for depression. I never thought of it as a possibility. But I gave it a chance. I took Adderall XR for many months and eventually Mydayis. Throughout that period, I realized I did have Adhd. (Depression was not just a size effect but irrelevant to this post). 

Taking medication had made me more calm overall, less anxious. I have tendencies to overthink all my life and although it still occurs, not as frequently. It made me actually be able to read through passages in class. I realized that so many things in my life made sense. Why I always switched between watching tv and doing homework as a kid because I couldn't stand to sit through doing a page. Why I overthink. Why I lose focus even if I'm trying so desperately not to. 

Then I joined this community on reddit. I learned more about ADHD. It gave me insight that I wasn't alone. That these were real symptoms of adhd, not high school like everybody in my family tells me it is. It makes me feel so much better. And yet frustrated to be misunderstood constantly. We all know that feeling. 

I want to cry. I want to cry because I'm so frustrated. I can't defend myself to others because they see me as a typical high schooler, lazy, or uneducated about ADHD and myself. It pushes me at all my points and especially my biggest insecurities that maybe I really am just all the things they accuse me of. That I don't have ADHD. What if they're right?

selftext: I’m a 37 year old male, 6’ 195 pounds, had some asthma when I was young but other than that I was generally healthy. It’s hard to pinpoint the time because it has been so long, but a little over 15 years ago my head started to hurt constantly followed shortly or possibly all at the same time by my entire right side of my body. There are 3 main pain points. Behind my eye a stabbing pain, through my abdomen feeling as if I’m being skewered, and my foot. The first 3 doctors I went to told me I was imagining the pain because nothing showed up on tests. According to the tests I was perfectly healthy. Then I was diagnosed with internal shingles, it wasn’t that, then post herpetic neuralgia, wasn’t that, eventually was given every blood test and body scan multiple times all showing nothing was wrong. It was after the 12 year point that I was diagnosed with Lyme disease and went through 3 years of horrible antibiotics and just all around unpleasant pharmaceuticals. According to my doctor, Dr. Jemsek, my numbers vastly improved and I was looking better. Only one problem, I’m still in constant pain on the right side of my body. The only time I’m pain free is when I’m asleep so I like to sleep. As soon as I’m awake the pain hits me. I was able to function and work and support myself up until these last few years. I’m constantly so tired, and my pain is always there. I’ve had a headache for over 15 years straight. I’m honestly surprised I’ve managed as well as I have. Life is thoroughly unenjoyable and my condition has made me pull away from pretty much everything and everyone. I’m still going to see new doctors but I’m nevoer optimistic going to see a new one. No one can tell me why I’m in pain all the time. My head is by far the worst. It feels like my occipital nerve is being pinched or something and it feels like I’m being stabbed through my eye from front to back. Same with my abdomen and foot. I can’t work and have been fortunate enough to be able to stay with my mom but I basically have no life, nothing excites me anymore and I feel like I’m just circling the drain. Does anyone have any ideas as to why one side of my body is in constant pain? I’ve been on every nerve pain medication known to man, none of them helped. I’m referring to Lyrica, gabapentin....and so on. Right now I take Marinol, oxycodone, and Xanax. The opioids are recent, doctors would only give me “nerve” pain meds which never worked so I finally went to a pain doctor. I was on the fentanyl patch as well but weened myself off of that because I can live the rest of my life on pain meds, at least don’t want to.

selftext: Hi , this is my first Reddit account . I am 24 years old , and all through out life especially as a teen , I knew something was off about me . I was told a lot that I was weird , over dramatic , a basket case , and would just act irrational over little things . I never noticed it , I was always in denial I guess , if someone was to point it out to me , I would get defensive and think they were attacking me . To make a long story short,  here recently I was spiraling out of control mentally . I was ripping my hair out (trichotillomania) and self mutilating and also some days be bubbly and full of energy (manic) and then wanting to just die (depression) I never noticed any of that , to me it was normal . It got so bad that a very close friend of mine took me in and had me admitted to a mental health institute because I was just going to kill myself , I was going to swallow my whole bottle of Xanax.   After being in the pshyc ward for a week, I was diagnosed with bi polar 1 / manic depressive . This was obviously news to me , I didn't know anything about bi polar for that matter . They put me on mood stabilizers and now I've been on them for about a month , and I am slowly starting to see a difference . And since I've been diagnosed , I've done research and everything , it makes so much since to why I have acted in the past , it's all come together like a puzzle . It is emotional to me in a way because I know now that before when I was having "my moments" it really wasn't my fault and I went so long thinking I was weird , crazy , and wondering what the fuck was wrong with me and now I know . I can tell now also , well kind of , when I'm manic , so I am seeing a slight difference and starting to notice . When I am manic , I stay up all night long coming up with great ideas , listening to music , and any other random tasks that seem unnessisary thats late at night , such as wanting to bake cookies to painting my nails at 3 AM lol and feel fine the next day . Before , I just thought,  "okay , I just won't sleep,  I'm just like that sometimes and I'll catch up on sleep later" so basically what this long post is saying , if you think you may have an illness or if friends and family believe you are Ill,  then listen to them . It's life changing , get some help and you are not alone . It took me going to a pshyc ward . You can avoid that by listening to your loved ones and see a psychiatrist.  I know now that I'm not insane , I am just ill and in recovery . I still have manic days , that will always be something I will live with but the meds will manage that more . Wish all of you the best if you are going through the same .

selftext: I am in the United States.

I have diagnosed unpiloar depression and generalized anxiety disorder which is being treated with CBT and an SSRI. I was first diagnosed with depression at age 13 and the anxiety disorder in my twenties, it's a little unclear to me exactly when because for me the two disorders seem to feed off each other and aren't super distinct. I was in recovery until this past year when I was diagnosed with a treatable but incurable autoimmune disease and had some traumatic health crises. My doctor started me on dexamethasone for pain management and I think it is contributing to psychiatric issues.

Since childhood I've had what I can only describe as some kind of nonautistic movement disorder. My hands/arms/legs/tongue move involuntarily whenever I'm engaged in deep thought imagining hypothetical scenarios. They don't need to be negative ones- just something emotionally exciting. I was never diagnosed with anything because my childhood psychologist said I was developing normally and would grow out of it. My parents basically just interrupted the behavior and shamed me into self-vigilance so I wouldn't do it in front of people, since onlookers thought I was having a seizure and it embarrassed my parents. But I just kept doing it in private my whole life. I'm not really aware of the movements until something interrupts me. It's more the mental state that triggers them and if I stay in the present moment they don't happen.

Since starting dexamethasone and having a relapse of depression/anxiety, I've had several episodes of intense agitation and my involuntary movements have also gotten more frequent to the point where I've had trouble at work. My therapist says that I don't have a movement disorder and that everything I'm experiencing is just psychomotor agitation. I don't believe this to be true. For me the mental state that prompts involuntary hand/leg movements is totally different than being agitated. It is always associated with intense internal imagery and stops immediately if someone talks to or touches me though I might still seem distracted or out of touch with reality for a minute. In contrast, if I'm agitated, I might pace or even kick things out of anger, I can talk to people but might seem incoherent, and I'm aware of my surroundings. Also agitation usually has an external trigger for me, like something startling me, whereas the other kind of excited movement is purely my own thoughts triggering it.

I guess I'm wondering if I should seek out a formal diagnosis for a movement disorder and how to go about doing this without upsetting my therapist or sounding like I'm trying to undermine him. I don't know if it will affect my treatment plan or not. It may not matter. But I sort of want a clearer answer as to what it is and how it can be managed especially since I feel like there's a risk of me becoming fixated on it and guilt-tripping myself over it. On the other hand, it is pretty harmless other than distracting me a lot at work and making people think there's something wrong with me, so I don't know if that's a good use of resources.

Any treatments for CMV?  Is there anything we can do to help her?  Will this get better? 
 Worse?

My daughter was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus last year.  But she has had the fatigue/body feels 'yucky'/no fever blahs/ since 3 or 4.  Happens 2-3 times a year.  I think CMV makes flu season worse.  Like she gets the flu twice while we get it once.  We can tell when she has it because she craves naps, doesn't eat much and gets meek.  

We feel helpless and sorry for her.  It lasts 1-2 weeks.  With no fever, she goes to school.  Sucks but we both work.

Is there anything that can help her?  Anything we can do?

I think that this book really helped with my understanding of ASD and I am curious as to how people who actually exist on that spectrum feel about this book?

selftext: I’ve been having bouts of (mainly) health anxiety for about 6 months but not diagnosed as actual disorder. CBT and talk therapy have helped immensely but I have one big trigger made worse by (regrettable) symptom surfing: fainting aka vasovagal syncope. 
Some fainting symptoms I found included:
   - sweating
   - palpitations
   - nausea
   - fear
   - fatigue
   - lightheadedness
   - blurred vision

See how similar they are to garden-variety anxiety/panic symptoms? This has me genuinely worried because I’m wondering if all this time I have some vagus nerve/fainting problem and it’s not anxiety. All my previous panic attacks were triggered by symptoms like these, and I felt like I actually might faint. I don’t feel like I’m hyperventilating during these attacks and my heart rate isn’t overly pounding either. These episodes mainly occur when I’m sitting (like for dinner) and sometimes I can barely make it through. I start sweating all over, I feel like I’m sinking into the chair, my vision blurs, and I have a deep fear that I’ll just faint and shut down suddenly. 

I’m still getting over reading about swallowing, pooping,and stretching syncope (apparently people can faint from just swallowing, crapping, or stretching cause it stimulates the vagus nerve; needless to say I was on edge for a good 2 weeks). I’ve conquered all the random self diagnoses like brain tumors, MS, and diabetes, but this one of fainting won’t go away. Help?

selftext: I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not diagnosed nor asking for a diagnose, only found similarities in my unhealthy behaviour. Partly here to sort out my thoughts and partly to see if I run through someone with a similar history, regardless where my behaviour falls - I just feel so conflicted after my realization that I was unfair towards someone for so long and could've easily damaged their own health because in retrospect, my behaviour _was_ damaging towards others.

---

For a longer time I was aware that I could get absurdly upset over nothing in my friendships, and I always attributed it to "there's very few people who I get along with, I'm very selective". It got really strong while I was dating a great guy. I had lots of conflicting thoughts on if he cares or not - always something snapped and I got really verbal at him because of my false beliefs and could make a terrible drama out of nothing. It was as if I was looking for problems while in reality my perception was completely skewed.

* Was he late a bit? Instant feeling of sadness followed by me thinking he doesn't give a damn about me.

* A phrasing that could be interpreted in a negative way? Of course he could NOT meant it any other way.

* Does he go one time drinking on Friday while I "really wanted him to hang out with me"? No way, he's probably being selfish.

* Was he online and hasn't msged me yet? Blimey, he probably forgot about me, I'm not important enough!

* Has he forgot about something of small importance? Again, I'm unimportant and he must hate me.

And so forth. I told him lots of terrible things based on my delusional thinking because of seeing things differently than how they are. I impulse-broke up things with him many times and I tortured him with my needy'ness. I never realized I could be wrong even though he literally was telling me things like: "Calm down, I do care. Just because I do hang out with other people doesn't mean I don't." And such.

During one of my tantrum about a half a year ago we stopped talking, and I wasn't trying to talk to anyone else much in the meantime because I had this one clue: for some reason, I cannot control how I feel around people and smallest things trigger me.

Yes, I'm not saying that I have BPD (I think I'm saying I relate and seem to show similar signs, which actually serves as a guide to troubleshoot my specific problems) - could be anything else, really - but I happened to be looking for coping strats for my issues and it suddenly all clicked after coming across this. I think it was while reading some ABCD coping strategy where it occured to me that I NEVER considered that I might be wrong (any positive possible outcome seems like an automatical no-no, while my negative thinking is always present to me in friendship affairs). This was so shocking and enlightening at once. I got a hand on some books that have coping strats and it works for me and that's all I care about - eradicating unhealthy behaviour. Out of nowhere I'm more aware that I have this false way of seeing things and I'm trying to understand why I act the way I have had. Over the last weeks I at least stopped snapping at him (we're friends for a long time now) based of how I feel or what my initial impulse-thought is and I'm really happy about it.

I'd be happy to hear how you've been managing coping with your friends after you got diagnosed and treated, or anything else really.

selftext: Tl;dr: 26 years old, accepted to school for animation. Getting my life together one step at a time. 


So this is a little late and a little odd but I am so so excited ✨✨

For background:
I was diagnosed as a kid and stopped my meds in junior high. Struggled through highschool and barely made the marks to pass after spending an extra year. Got re-diagnosed with ADHD-C. Always loved art and wanted to go to art school, went to a local college for game design and got put on academic probation and ultimately got kicked out in the first year. Went back the next year and dropped out around the same time.  
That was in 2010-2011.
Since then, I realized I never stopped wanting to be an artist, and everything I follow online is based around animation. I moved to Toronto and decided to apply for animation school. (Sheridan is the more prestigious school to go to, but I decided on the more local, and imo just as good, Seneca). I decided on a whim and the portfolio was due in a week. I was working 2 jobs and still not on meds. I got the portfolio done! It wasn't great, but IT. WAS. DONE.  I submitted it and got on the waitlist and didn't get in. That was for January. I decided my goal was no matter how long it takes, I'm getting in. I couldn't afford the prep courses or art fundies courses so I was just gonna have to do it myself.
I redid my portfolio for September, while doing it some personal drama happened, a friend of mine who also has ADHD was staying with me and working from home, and I got very abruptly fired from my job. 
I FINISHED. ANOTHER. PORTFOLIO. Again not my best, but I finished it and I am so proud of myself. 
I got waitlisted and felt a bit discouraged but knowing when the deadlines are for the winter admission this time around will ensure I kick this portfolios ass! 


BUT THEN I GOT A LETTER IN THE MAIL. 
I got bumped up from the waitlist and got officially accepted into animation school! I got the letter the same day I started back on my Vyvanse. 
I'm 26, and I can't wait to become an animator. 


Its a small victory for some, but to me finishing two portfolios and achieving something I set my mind to is just... Everything I've wanted. 🙏

selftext: I have ADHD and have only recently been diagnosed. I am 33, and I have no job, no job prospects, no relationship, no university education. I am overweight with borderline type-2 diabetes, poor diet, very poor fitness and every time I try to exercise my body hurts the entire time until I stop, no matter how long I persist in doing even the lightest of work outs. I have absolutely no will power.

All of this because I was diagnosed at 33 instead of when I was much younger. All of my teachers said I was an intelligent boy, and would do well if I would apply myself. I was well behaved so they just thought I was lazy. Sometimes I wish I had been a little shit, and my life might not be shit.

Not only do I feel like I can no longer get back into the only work I've ever been offered (call centre work, oh joy) but that I just no longer want to work at all. I have become bitter and angry with the way that the entire world is set up for people like me to fail, and I am afraid of failing like they want me to to the point where I don't even want to try any more.

And I am lonely. I live by myself because the only relationship I ever had crumbled the moment I tried to set some boundaries with my ex-partner who had been abused all her life and because all of her boundaries had been broken and crushed she didn't know where mine were and couldn't cope when I tried to show her.

I don't go out because I hate drinking alcohol and being around people drinking alcohol and that seems to be all people ever do, I don't work, and I don't attend any educational facilities so I can't meet people in real life. I apparently can't help only ever being attracted to people who already have a partner and then feeling bitter and angry about that. I can't talk to people about feelings and have enormous social anxiety about being rejected. I have tried using Plenty of Fish but no one ever responds to the point where I have the paranoid feeling that PoF doesn't even send my messages because I don't pay them any money.

I am waiting for the NHS psychiatrist to get back to me with a plan for medicating this shitty condition, and basically all my hopes are pinned on medication fixing everything for me because I don't like hard work. If it doesn't work, I don't know what I'm going to do. I hate this.

selftext: Yesterday for some reason I decided to tell a friend of mine, who I’ve known since childhood, that I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking medication for a few months. 

The conversation started because we both have anxiety. She asked me how I deal with my anxiety and I told her that since I started seeing a psychologist and have been taking Methylphenidate my anxiety is limited to PMS days. 

My friend started sending me a slew of opinions regarding ADHD and how over diagnosed it is in the United States and how if ANYONE takes ADHD medication they’ll feel great. It will improve anyone’s concentration and mood. She went on to say that psychotropic medications will burn out your neurotransmitters and receptors and once you try to go off of them you’ll be dependent. She said she’s known me for a long time and she doesn’t see that I have ADHD. She says I’m not hyperactive and don’t have any of the symptoms. She says that NO ONE likes to study and it has to do with immaturity not a mental illness. Lastly, she said that she struggles with anxiety every day and, if she let it get the better of her, she wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning. She struggles and fights with her anxiety and thinks that is what I should do to. I should try any other option except medication. 
Why is struggling internally morally superior to looking for help and taking medication that helps you?
 
Psychology and psychiatry have always been seat of the pants disciplines. There is no blood test you can do to get a diagnosis of anxiety or depression or ADHD. There is a set of symptoms and if you have them you get the diagnosis. I have always been wary of medication that changes brain chemistry. I have a BA in psychology and realize that there are different theories of mental illness. Some people believe we’re medicalizing normal behavior. Some people believe that environmental influences are what need to be changed. 

All I know is that I’ve struggled my entire life and this beautiful little pill allows me to be functional for 4 hours out of the day. It stabilizes my mood, it allows me to be present and fulfill the duties of everyday life, and it allows me to cope with my life. 

I’m so angry that there is such a stigma against medication and ADHD. You struggle with mental illness and then on top of it you are belittled and dismissed by those closest to you. 

How do you guys deal with it? Any insight is greatly appreciated!

selftext: I can't seem to rid myself of this idea that I'm too fucking weird to fit in anywhere in society.

It's not that I'm too unstable, or too stupid. It's that I'm too socially awkward, inexperienced, and childlike. And I have no idea how the fuck to change that. I'm 28, isn't this more or less who I am?

I barely get outside these days. I'm definitely an extrovert, a joker, very loud, and a [diagnosed attention whore](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/8g4pyh/my_therapist_thinks_i_have_histrionic_personality/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) (but she only said "traits", so I guess that's good?) I have some autistic traits (was diagnosed with Asperger's at 11) and I have really bad social anxiety, that doesn't keep me quiet and is thus pointless. Instead, I end up ruminating for hours after the fact about some stupid thing I said.

But my therapist told me the other day that even though I appear this way on the surface, I have very good insight and am very much aware of how other people perceive me.

I just don't understand myself. My entire personality makes no sense.

I'm thinking of breaking back into the restaurant industry, but I'm so afraid I would never be able to do front-of-house stuff. It was my favorite part of my last job (turns out they don't care how much you get tipped with fast food.) But I'm just so afraid I'm not cut out for this, that no amount of practice will ever make me more "normal".

And with the very real impending threat of homelessness hanging over my head, I'm going to have to approach a lot of people for help. I'm not ready for it. I'm just not ready.

Anyone else relate to this?

selftext: Haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I'm having some trouble and I don't know where else I would post this so here goes.

I've always been internally sort of sad. I second-guess myself a lot, I think about how I've let my family down and caused them trouble that they really don't deserve, and I generally don't like myself. But I've always been able to sort of tough it out and look on the bright side of things. My life has been pretty good, so finding that side isn't too hard. I have some friends, I enjoyed certain activities, and my sadness was manageable. But recently, it's gotten worse. The things that brought me great joy and made life worth living aren't fun anymore. Externally I think I'm still the same, but there isn't anything right now that's worth getting up for. I don't like waking up. The day ahead isn't something to look forward too anymore. Life just isn't fun anymore. I do things because if I didn't, my loved ones would suffer. That's my only motivation for getting dressed now.

So the question is: should I see a therapist? I think I know why this is happening, so should I just wait for it to pass and figure it out then, or should I do something about it now?

selftext: So today I had a decently big fight with my mtf gf. Little background, she has been diagnosed as bipolar for several years now. It took me months and several episodes of her ending up in the hospital for her to finally get on medication.

But she takes them for a while then decides she's better and stops taking them. When she stops taking them she gets awful. Just picks fights over the stupid things (You can read some of my post history if you want more details on today's fight) After she cooled down a bit she said sorry and admitted she hasn't been taking her medication for almost a month now.

I'm so upset with her. She knows she gets just mean and awful when she's not taking her medication I just don't understand why she doesn't take them. It negatively affects our relationship so much and she says such hurtful things. I just don't understand her mindset when she stops taking them.

I have bipolar disorder myself so I know medication can kind of sucks, sorta numbs things and you miss the ups but I haven't missed a dose in 4 years. I realized how awful I get without the meds so why can't she? I just don't understand and I kind of hate her for it.

Along with this she is very very poor and was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis when I was about 8 or 9 years old. She’s had health issues related to MS since then obviously. Her health has deteriorated to a point where I don’t think she even knows what her reality it, has trouble walking, and doing basic tasks. I feel really bad but at the same time she treated me like complete shit growing up, like i was an inconvenience on her life and I was better off shut off in my room not to be seen or heard from. Should I help her? 

Note: I live 5 hours away from here 

Update: Thanks for the advice guys! I appreciate you guys taking the time out to leave feedback. I ended up calling her to see how she’s been doing but have not gone down visit yet. I’m sure I will eventually but right now I’m just not ready. She continues to defend her actions from when I was growing up and hasn’t apologized... so not sure what to do. I was hoping she would and that we could talk and work through things. Sadly that’s not the case as of yet.

selftext: This has been bothering me for a while, and it's really starting to piss me off. Sometimes, I will close on of my eyes, (winking or just blinking because somethings in it) and I feel the need to close the other ones so it feels "balanced". that doesn't make a lot of sense but I feel like if anyone would understand that weird feeling of trying to balance stuff with your body it would be you guys. A lot of times i get stuck in the cycle of just winking repeatedly with either eye and I just look like I'm tweaking out and it's so irritating and pisses me off. 
This also happens when i'm carrying stuff. If I carry groceries the weight has to be equal on both of my hands or I'll be super un-satisfied.
Anyone else have an issue with this or anything related to what I experience? I feel like i'm going crazy

Edit: I have not been diagnosed with OCD; and I don't like self diagnosis (so i should probably see a medical professional) but I have a number of things that I can relate to on certain posts in this subreddit, and I just hope someone can relate to this so I know it's not just me. thanks

Currently not taking any medications, I'm not a smoker, I don't drink, and I have no known allergies. I'm Filipino, I was born in the Philippines. I currently live in California.

I was diagnosed with pericarditis on October 2017. Other than that I don't really have any problems.

This all started about a week ago. At first I had trouble swallowing food, then shortness of breath a few days later. I feel tired all the time ever since this started.   

My throat feels kind of tight and my Adam's apple has grown a little, I think. Every time I try to look down I can feel something stuck in my throat (am I feeling my Adam's Apple?). I have heart palpitations and this weird tightness in my chest. I don't feel any pain at all. 

Could this be pericarditis again? I started taking Motrin (ibuprofen) yesterday, but so far it's not helping at all. The last time I had pericarditis these were the exact same symptoms except the throat problems. 

I'm currently trying my best to just rest and drink plenty of water. But my symptoms aren't getting any better. I'm planning to go to an urgent care clinic tomorrow.

Eventually, my life took a big hit when I was diagnosed with bipolar and it’s been an uphill battle ever since. Haven’t had any physical intimacy in over three years. Even when things were going well, I relied heavily on social media to meet women. I never had the balls to make the approach in person, and I still don’t. At bars, I just stand in the corner watching people have the time of their lives, watching my friend hooking up every time we go out. I just have a hard time meeting women. Most of them lose interest in me after the fact anyway, so I fear ever making a move. I must be boring. I’m lucky I even have friends, it seems as though I latch onto one and then make friends with their friends. Because of this my social life is decent, but I’ve never had a girlfriend. And as long as I don’t, I’ll probably never feel truly fulfilled. My insecurity, shyness, and depression are making me drown.

Like, for example, one of the bosses would reel off a list of instructions for me and my oppo to do for the day. I'd then get in the van and say to my mate 'What does he want us to do?'  I couldn't take in the orders because they were rapid fire and while I am trying to process the implications of the first one he had barked off 6 jobs more.  Colleagues soon realised this and made my life difficult because of it.  But I wasn't stupid, I just needed orders written down unambiguously then I could carry out the task.   Sometimes the job can be fine yet it is the other people that make it needlessly difficult.  
        
During my first week at McDonalds in the 1990s someone asked me to count the gherkins left in stock.  The shift manager witnessed me do this and I thought I'll cheat and just make up a number.  Then I soon realised it was a prank, haha ok fair enough, but the shift manager then had the nerve to have a go at me for doing something so stupid on company time.  I was 19 and quite naive.

Long story short, I have a single friend at college, who is an extrovert and basically "adopted" me. She's mad at me and I didn't notice until yesterday, when she texted me saying why she was acting weird. It was because of a sexist joke that a classmate told us, a joke that I didn't react to (I didn't like it, but I didn't say anything to the guy).

She said that my silence hurt her, that I should have done something. The thing is, I really feel that I *can't,* that I just don't have the courage to tell someone when I don't like what they do. Moreover, I have a hard time telling what people feel, it's just not easy.

She doesn't believe me, and it hurts. I apologized, I promised to change, because I'm already working on it with my therapist. Nothing worked, she is not talking to me.

I just feel lonely, because even my parents think that I should just *decide* to talk, like it was that simple.

Anyways, sorry for the rant, I just wanted to tell someone.

I've only been seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication (zoloft) for about six weeks, so I don't have a whole lot of coping mechanisms (and the zoloft hasn't helped that much at this point). I'll be starting IOP in about a week but I'm struggled with how to deal with life after getting out of the hospital. I've already self harmed again and I got out on Friday. I'm really anxious about how to explain it to people (especially since most people in my life don't know that I have mental health issues at all) and how to deal with people's questions at work because I don't really want to disclose my mental illness to most of my coworkers -- but I don't really know how to explain away five days in the hospital. I don't have a really specific question but I was just wondering if anyone who has been hospitalized before has any advice for how to deal with re-entering "normal" life??

*I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet (beyond what's necessary for insurance purposes) so I'm not sure that I have BPD but I think I have some BPD traits

I'm unmedicated, partly because my mom sees whether I visit my university's health center and can see what I buy, and she's extremely anti\-med. \(And anti\-ADHD, I got the diagnosis behind her back.\) 

I've always struggled with feeling stupid for the majority of my life, but it's been especially bad this semester. I cry about it at least once or twice a week.  I just feel so slow. It takes me eons longer to understand something than it takes my friends. I can never relate to people on this subreddit or elsewhere because so many people with ADHD self\-proclaim to be smart as individuals, they just struggle in other aspects of their life because of their illness that then hurts their intelligence. For me, I feel like I'd be stupid ADHD or not. I think it definitely exacerbates the problem, like how my memory sucks and how I need to read something 5x over to understand it. But... I don't know. I'm just tired of feeling worthless all the time.

I smoked joints like chain smokers. Because the high was not the same any more.

I thought i liked a girl and was going to stay with her for the rest of the course. She told me no and then started the worst time of my life. I thought i had a connection with God. I was delusional and paranoid. I thought military was looking for me because I had paranormal powers, like I was some VIP or something.

I had to be brought to a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with cannabis induced psychosis. It's been 5 months since the diagnosis. I am on antipsychotic medications. I can't enjoy life. The things that I used to find interesting are not interesting anymore. It's a situation I won't wish upon my worst enemy.

selftext: I love smoking, i love the smell, i love the culture, i love every part of it from rolling a spliff to ripping a bowl. However sadly i’m too young (15 born in 2003). I’ve been smoking for about a year now and honestly it wouldn’t be a big deal if i weren’t smoking as often as i do (up to 4 times a day every day) it’s gotten to the point when i’m either fried or asleep. My biggest problem though is that this has upset my parents a lot, they found out i smoke and they’ve taken me to psychiatrists trying to help but my problem isn’t some undiagnosed mental health disorder (i was diagnosed with a few though) my problem is that i love smoking. It’s also been affecting my grades, i’ve never been a good student (far from it) but i just started high school i’m in grade 9 and i’ve already failed 2 courses in first semester and it looks like i’m failing at least 1 more in this semester. So out of 8 credits i should have by    July i’m gonna be getting 5. What advice do u have on quitting when u genuinely enjoy

selftext: 28 (M) 185lbs 6”. PMH of Hypertension, depression and anxiety. Drinks 2-3 beers 3-4 days a week. Recreational marijuana.1mg klonopin 1x day and 25mg atenolol 1x day. 
Okay so long story short 10 year ago he was diagnosed with hypertension, depression, and anxiety.  He was going through a really hard time due to mid terms. His mom being a nurse and having anxiety took him to the family Dr and basically pressured the Dr into prescribing him 1mg klonopin Daily, and atenolol 25mg daily. 
He was on the KP for 3 months and came off to start taking abilify. He had a bad reaction to abilify and the Dr put him back on Klonopin. Well here we are 10 years later and he’s trying to get off of it. Were also in the process of finding him a new Dr since this one doesn’t seem to care to help him. 
Is there any advice of how to come off klonopin without having withdrawals extremely bad? 
In the past when he has weaned himself down he went into withdrawals to the point that he was scared he was gonna have a seizure. 
Also does anyone know any long term affects of him taking it this long? TIA!

selftext: I was diagnosed with bipolar II just a few months ago. In therapy yesterday, we were able to link childhood trauma to my traumatic summer in 2017. To keep it short, we talked about my feelings of guilt over not being able to protect my sister from the sexual abuse done to us over 5 years as kids, and the lack of control I felt as a kid because of the abuse. She connected this to me not feeling control this past summer while my father was in the hospital 1. because I couldn't help my dad, and 2. I felt a lack of control with the rest of the family over\-ruling the responsibility that was placed on me to make decisions and give out information, and to make matters worse, my sister got upset with me for trying to just do my job. She threw my then just anxiety and depression in my face to hurt me and she and I no longer speak.

Sure, I had tendencies before, but the relationship between these 2 situations truly brought it out. Very Interesting. I never linked the 2 before, but she truly feels that all those feelings I felt as a kid came back in the way of bipolar.

selftext: We know that us BPDers seem to struggle heavily with a a sense of self. And it's daunting. We constantly seem to grapple with validation and seem to never know our boundaries while we seek that.

8 months of therapy. A lot of self discovery. Still slipping and struggling.

And then my exSO said something last night on message which really tore me apart. I guess, if she would've said this last year or so, my BPD would've kicked in and made me do something to retaliate or cloud that. Unfortunately, with me constantly trying hard with my therapy, this time, it just pierced through.

And it hurt like hell.

I usually tend to badger myself a lot on who I am and how I'm not worth anything. 

But this, really shook me up.

I feel beyond terrible as a person. 

I don't know what to do. What to think. How to be. I can't make sense of anything right now. 

Everything is just seeming hazy as fuck right now.

It really really hurt. Maybe it did because I've genuinely cared for her \- but have always broken her heart because of my stupid fucking BPD behaviours \(before I was diagnosed\). 

I don't know. I just cannot rationalise anything right now.

I want to melt and burn away.

selftext: In the last few months I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI and was started on stimulant medication.  I tried a slew of different types and different dosages and I always had some bad side effects that made me not want to take it very often, despite seeing good benefits as well.

Finally just a few days ago I was feeling fed up and tried ultra low doses of my two medications that seemed to work the best.  I am talking 2.5mg Adderall for short periods of time or 10mg Vyvanse for a long day of coverage.  I have found these doses still have ~80% of the benefits and no downsides as the fuller doses I had been trying.

My question is - is this normal?  Anyone else?  My doctor is baffled by it and says that she has never seen someone respond well to that low of a dose, even a child.  For reference I am a 28 year old male, 165 pounds, 5'11"

Any input from other ultra-low dosers out there would be appreciated!

TL;DR - I take 2.5mg Adderall or 10mg Vyvanse and find it mostly as effective but with fewer downsides.  Doctor thinks this is strange, especially for my age.

selftext: I went through a hellish breakup recently and it’s sent me completely off the rails. I was taking codeine pills and tramadol (tried to kill myself by taking like 15 of the latter, OD’D but didn’t die) and over the past week I’ve done cocaine and Xanax and ecstasy twice (one of those was a 2 day binge) and downed an entire bottle of DMX and was tweaking the fuck out for three days straight thought I might have brain damage for a second. All while smoking weed every second of every day. I sleep maybe 3 hours a night, I barely eat. I’m going through absolute hell and I really don’t know how to get myself under control at this point. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder last year, I have always had severe mental health  issues but everything that’s happened recently has permanent tweaked me. I will never be the same. Every second of every day I’m just searching for a way to silence my thoughts so I can stop thinking about her for one fucking second...I know if I wasn’t taking drugs though I’d probably just slit my wrists and die though.

And my friend up in this city makes me feel like shit whenever I don't see him. My mental health is in piece and I've applied for mitigating circumstances but I don't even want to resit or spend any more time here/ in formal education than I need too. Anyone got any advice for me? I keep crying (which I don't do often at all) and and really struggling.

selftext: I recently dropped out of college temporarily to start taking my life in my own direction. I started for a bachelors in electrical engineering but quickly realized that my reasoning for doing so was very naive:
1. Electricians make above decent wages.
2. My father is a very skilled electrician. (I live with him)
3. I have my foot in the door at the factory my father works for.
I am not okay mentally. I do not know what is wrong with me, and won't diagnose myself. What I do know is that I have attempted suicide twice in the last 6 months, can never focus, and am overall rather stupid. Me taking time off from college was supposed to give me the free time to help fix my problems. I was supposed to get fit, seek psychological help, and start doing projects that will lead me to a career I actually want. I have not been able to come up with anything solid, and I am at my wits end. Time does not feel real to me and the only thing holding me in check is my fast-food job. 
Please suggest something I can start doing with my life that will give me some kind of direction.

selftext: Hello, 

I am a 28 year old male, no significant health issues up until this past November. Not currently taking any medication. I've been diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, pretty big one at that (3.5cm). 

I've got surgery next Tuesday. I've read everything I can and obviously spoke with the surgeons. What am I signing up for? I'm deaf in my left ear already, so I know that ship has sailed. I know about the facial weakness that occurs with surgery(although I don't have any right now, maybe some VERY subtle numbness in my left lower lip, and a tiny tiny bit in the back of my tongue). Am I going to look maligned for the rest of my life? Is the end goal of this surgery for me to be "normal," or just so this tumor doesn't eventually kill me? I know a ton of the risks have to do with it being a 10-15 hour surgery, but I've handled anesthesia in the past well. I'm kind of rambling now... I guess I'm just looking to see what more in depth what I'm signing up for... Even though I've heard it a million times. I'm ready for this to be over.

selftext: It's taken me about two years too long, but I finally saw a psychiatrist about my inability to concentrate.

I was diagnosed when I was in middle school and was on Dexadrine to control the symptoms. It worked. My grades improved, as well as my overall mood and mental state.

In high school, however, I realize but I didn't like the person the medicine turned me into. My personality was flat. After speaking with my doctor we tried non-medical ways to alleviate the symptoms. It worked for the most part, and I was able to go medicine free up into college.

I'm 34 now, and over the last two to three years I could feel the symptoms rearing their ugly head.  An inability to concentrate, I lazy work ethic, and an overall 'meh' feeling toward most things finally led me to calling a doctor last week to schedule an appointment.

I officially started on adderal this morning, and I noticed a difference immediately. 

This may sound cliche, but I feel like an overall better person of myself, even just a few doses in.

I've subscribed to the subreddit, and I'm looking forward to sharing this journey with y'all.

selftext: So my last 2 post have been sad ish so funny story time! 
I'm a very open person with my teachers and people I don't really hide anything. A teacher asked how I was doing and I said actually really good I was diagnosed with adhd what explains a lot of everything. And she's like oh yeah I already new that. I then processed to ask her what she ment cuz I was very confused and she proceeds to tell me oh yeah there are so many signs that u have it. Since I've found out I've talked to three teachers and they are not shocked what so ever. I'm graduating this year and usely really interested in new topics in school and got okay grades even with out caring as I used to say the hard part were the work sheets and repition of work but it would have been so helpful to know how my mind operates just even three years ago but that is done with uni here I come with better equipment to hopefully study(in all honesty I probably won't study but I shall try)
Anyone else like this? Being good in school just terrible paying attention and getting work done on time and just slipped through the cracks?

selftext: I can't take it anymore! My life was just not meant to be. Everything has gone wrong in my life. At age 5\-6 I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism. Over the years it got better. Then last year my Dad had lost his job but found one. Because my mom got a tacher license in China she couldn't get a job here and couldn't return. So that had lowered my happiness until it took a turn for the worst. In 6th Grade I was bullied. 7th grade was ok than 8th grade plummeted to where we are now. I was hit by my dad 2 times. When I was 4 he had hit me with a wooden spoon. Then I got hit again in Dc during this years spring break. And in January of last year my brother had been in the car when he was drunk. When I was young, we would stay for the weekend and he would drink. My life is terrible. The only thing stopping me now is my cat \(Chloe\) but she has done the most she can do. Everybody on this earth is perfect except me and my family. Im sorry but i have to do this. The plastic bag. GoodBye

selftext: I have some pain and numbness in my arms around my armpit and sometimes inner elbow. Usually my left arm but does happen to both arms. Usually it's pretty bad in the mornings. It feels like I've got a kinked something another. I'm 27, male non smoker, overweight but not obease, fairly out of shape and high stress  (possibly some kind of anxiety or manic depressive but not diagnosed). I recently began drinking soda again after drinking nothing but water for a few years (which, starting tomorrow/today, I will go back to.) I assumed this has to do with my lack of exercise and diet rather than being some kind of major condition but a second opinion wouldn't hurt. At least until I get a new physician. My previous doc passed away some time ago, haven't been to one since. Thanks in advance!

Edit: numbness also goes to my hands sometimes but only breifly. My hands will hurt like they've been locked up and in between the knucles will ache. 
I saw a movie the other day and wile laughing pretty hard I felt my right hand go numb in sequence with my hard laughs. It was pretty strange feeling, but it didn't hurt or remain numb.

selftext: So i have been diagnosed with Tourettes syndrome for over 10 years now, and throughout my life I have seen strange things, not like full hallucinations, but like little stuff out of the corner of my eye, or hearing someone call my name. For example, today, while i was driving my car, i was on a small road, and when i went on a turn i could have sworn a white car was passing me and since it would have been dangerous for both of us i looked over so i could make sure i wasn't going to hit them or vice versa. When i looked over nothing was there, and then another time while i was working i thought there was a bug crawling on my shirt and when i was gonna brush it off there was nothing there. And occasionally as i mentioned i will hear someone call my name and when i look around to see who it is, nobody i know is around if anyone at all.

I'm not sure if i am experiencing this because of my tourettes, or if it is something that could possibly come along with tourettes.

Anyways I just wanted to come here for some opinions so i can discuss possible reasons this is happening with my doctor and hopefully get this figured out sooner than later. Thanks

selftext: Hey everyone, I usually post on /r/NEET but I decided to share how I believe being diagnosed with Asperger's \(as well as anxiety and depression\) has made me an unsuccessful adult, despite my best efforts to be a "normal" person. I was diagnosed at age 5 and I am now 24, and I understand that there are worse things you can be diagnosed with than Asperger's, but for me at least, the terrible thing about having Asperger's is truly believing that you have what it takes to be a "normal" productive member of society, but not actually being able to do it because of societal factors that are out of your control. I know of people who were in rehab, basically made every bad life decision you could make, and still ended up having a decent job, friends, and a relationship. Meanwhile, I have a university degree, made decisions that successful adults would consider to be the "right" decisions, and yet I've been unemployed for 3 years, and have literally no social life to speak of. 

I know life was never meant to be fair, but when you begin to understand the disadvantage having this disorder puts you at it really is depressing. There's a reason why approximately 35 percent of individuals with Asperger's are attending college, but yet people with Asperger's have a 75\-85 percent unemployment rate. The average person underestimates how important social skills and being able to interact with others naturally like a "normal" human is, but when you lack that ability you are truly screwed in our society.

The really sad thing is there is hardly any help for adults with Asperger's. It seems like as soon as you turn 18 society forgets you exist and already expects you to be able to be a "normal" person. Unfortunately for many of us this is when our problems begin to get a lot worse. There are some work readiness programs for people with Autism, but many of these problems focus on individuals with medium functioning Autism who want to work for minimum wage and learn basic social skills so they can reach that goal. For people like myself who understand social skills in theory, and know they are capable of doing much more than working for minimum wage, there is nothing. 

The problem is employers want to hire people they view as confident, high energy, and in general fun to be around. When you have Asperger's, \(especially combined with anxiety and depression like I do\), this is literally impossible. I can pretend to be the characteristics viewed as positive by potential employers, but I still come across as awkward, not being genuine and in general very low energy and boring thanks to my monotone voice which is out of my control. I feel like next time I should just tell employers at interviews that "to be honest I do have Asperger's syndrome which can make it difficult for me to interact with others at times, but despite this, I truly believe that having Asperger's also will make me a harder worker than the other people applying for this job, as I am eager to prove myself, take pride in my work, and am more than qualified for this position". Unfortunately I believe if I said this I'd immediately be taken off of a company's hiring list as soon as I said that word Asperger's.

I don't really know what else to say other than I'm tired of the same thing over and over. I know that I am intelligent enough and a hard enough worker to be able to have a respectable job. I know that I am attractive and interesting enough to be in a relationship with something. I know that I am adventurous enough and kind enough to be a good friend, but I can't do any of these things because of the expectations that society puts on social skills. The thing about Asperger's is there is literally nothing wrong with many of us, it's just our society that makes a problem out of it. I truly believe that the world would be a much better place if everyone had Asperger's.

To end this post I'd like to say one more thing about the successful people with Asperger's. because I know that there a few of them out there. I've noticed that nearly all of these people have a special interest that society values, combined with well above average intellect, and a social network that began through family connections. Unfortunately it seems like to me that for us to be on the same level of success as a "normal" person we need to have these three characteristics just to be able to complete with "normal" people.

selftext: I was telling my husband today that I have spent my entire life struggling. It was like I was thrown in a river the moment I was born and with every year I was abused as a child and  with every trauma I suffered, that river got swifter and more treacherous, always leading towards a huge waterfall that spilled into an abyss.

Because I was born to a "broken" mother, \(she was schizophrenic and chose to self medicate with alcohol\), who married a Vietnam veteran with PTSD who also self medicated with alcohol, I didn't learn to swim nor was I given a boat or a life raft.....I had to dog paddle, half drowning,  taking on gulps of water along the way.

By the time I was in my mid 30's, I was diagnosed for the first time as bipolar, suffering from PTSD from my childhood abuse and that stemming from my first marriage, and was self medicating with alcohol. By the time I was in my 40's,  I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I was a danger to myself: someone who refused to treat ANY of their physical or mental illnesses.

I will not go into the destruction of my life for it is a common theme for folks who suffer from mental illness and alcoholism as a result of self medicating said mental illnesses.  190 days ago I stopped that barreling down the river towards the abyss and reached out for the shore. DRY LAND!!!!!  It took a complete psychotic breakdown and though I have yet to hear from the court, I am facing 2 felonies and a DUI because I refused to face the fact that I was mentally ill JUST LIKE my mother......just like my dead brother. He went over the raging waterfall and killed himself in 2008 at age 38. He never stopped drinking. He never got help for his mental illnesses. I never stopped dog paddling, choking on the water, but trying to stay afloat long enough to reach the shore.......

and here I am........

It's been 190 days today.  I go to therapy every week for my PTSD and BiPolar/mood disorder  \(I guess that was MANIA and not just that I liked to talk a lot and was full of enormous amounts of energy......and had a bad temper sometimes....especially when drunk.\) I still fight the medications from the shrink...but when I am manic, \(I am pretty sure this is what prompted the bad week that got me arrested that day. I didn't even have half my clothes on....didn't know where I was...don't remember a thing and my BAC wasn't that high.......\) I have to take something or I start to spin out of control REALLY fast..... and I am back on my seizure medications. I am middle aged, so the medical stuff seems to never end...

BUT I AM SOBER........

I made it to the shore and am on dry land............I just have to learn how to walk now on water logged legs  :\)

selftext: Backround: A year and a half ago I had a psychotic episode that got me 5150'd in the hospital involuntarily for two weeks. I was failing classes, quit my job, and was borderline underweight. 

Since then, I've been diagnosed as Bipolar 2, started taking medications, and have been doing much better \(even making dean's list last semester\). I tried over winter break to go off meds again, and it turned the start of my most recent semester into a real shit show before I got my act together and started therapy and meds again. 

Now I'm starting summer break. My psychologist and psychiatrist agree it'd be a good idea for me to stay on meds over the break to keep me stable coming into next semester. 

I just spoke with my narcisistic mother over a long phone call today. I let her know my summer plans to get in shape, get a job, etc. She asked me about my meds and I told her why I wanted to stay on them. 

She told me taking drugs will ruin my liver and other organs, and implied I'll become infertile. She said 'Dad won't be able to help pay for medication if something happens and he loses his job'. She said I can fix my brain chemistry with diet and exercise, and I should just go Raw Vegan \(I'm already going vegan anyway\). She said 'real life' and work is harder than school, and wanted to know how I'll cope when life \*really\* gets stressful. She said Dad 100&amp;#37; agrees with her that I should get off meds ASAP instead of being on them 'for life'. She said I should join a 12 step program for anxiety to 'get to the root' of my mental health issues and solve my anxiety. She said she and Dad took depression meds for a while, and they mutually decided they didn't want to take them anymore so I should as well. She reminded me I'm only on my parents' insurance for 2 more years \(I'll be graduated by the time 

I told her I'd consider her points, but asked her to consider mine as well. You can't cure brain chemistry with positive thinking. I don't want to waste expensive out of state tuition because I'm to depressed to attend classes and do homework. I literally had psychosis and had to be hospitalized for it. I don't want to be on meds necessarilly forever; just long enough to finish my intense, competitive  BFA program. 

She just said "Well it sounds like you've made up your mind. You should really Google your medication's side effects; it's killing you. And look up natural alternatives to your problems because they exist.  \(She doesn't even know what meds I take or what I was diagnosed with until I told her tonight\). 

Do any of you have to deal with crummy people butting in on your life? What do you do when it's someone you can't just shut up and shut out?

tl;dr: Mom wants me to stop taking meds, refused to listen to me, and threw every psudoscience reason in the book to justify herself.

selftext: I went through several “Can you have an ADHD?” articles and came this result: I have 4 signs of inattentiveness (while 6 signs are required) and I don’t remember any signs when I was a kid (I’m 21 now). On the other hand, the symptoms happen in more than 1 environment and I have had them for over 2 years while at least 6 months are required. 

So, while satisfy some requirements, I don’t satisfy all of them (of the required ones). Any chance I can still be diagnosed as ADHD or is it likely in my case that ADHD is not my problem? 

And is there anybody else who was in similar situation and got diagnosed?

Then he gets pissed off and he'll leave or drink. 😓 I'll try to offer sex on my own terms and he rejects me. He's been saying he wants to sleep with other people and I'm considering it just to be left alone. Anyone else dealing with this or have advice?

selftext: 20 years old, male, 5'10, 125 lbs, caucasian:

Let me preface this by saying that as far as I know, I don't have an eating disorder, and I believe this is strictly a physical issue rather than a mental one (like anorexia), but I do have adhd (diagnosed late at age 19). My brain thrives on adderall, but it completely kills my appetite, which being as naturally small as it is has been pretty detrimental and I almost never eat anymore.

I've been underweight my entire life, always short and skinny, and I've never been a very big eater. When I was a kid, my friends would devour plates of food endlessly, but I would get full so quickly I could rarely finish my food. My parents always made sure I was fed, I just didn't eat very much overall.

When I started getting older, I started having to rely on myself more for food, and developed some bad eating habits to the point of just not eating sometimes because my adhd gave me no motivation to take care of myself.

These habits have continued on and off (sometimes my appetite will skyrocket for a day or few before reverting back to more of the same). When I was diagnosed with adhd and started on adderall, it reinforced my lack of appetite and I was usually barely hungry enough for 2 meals a day, never 3.

I've since then stopped taking my adderall, but my appetite doesn't seem to want to return. What habits should I get into and how I can train my body to be able to eat more without feeling sick?

I’ve had the difference explained to me by like 5 different doctors but literally all of them gave me a different answer so that just confused me more. I personally think I have experienced “full blown mania” not just hypomania but I can’t really determine what the difference is exactly so I don’t know. My boyfriend is also type 2 but his symptoms are pretty different from mine - much more depression, less manic. Obvi I’m not looking for anyone to try and diagnose me but what has been your experience? Anyone know what the difference is or have experience getting diagnosed w one or the other?

selftext: So ever since I was young, I’ve always collected things, and my collections have to be perfect. I have been diagnosed with OCD, and I’ve talked to my doctor about this. She doesn’t seem too worried as it really isn’t out of control I guess, but it is costly and I am running out of room. I collect books, but I am ok giving those away if I didn’t enjoy them, so even though I overbuy, I don’t keep them all forever. Then I got hooked on candles &amp; wax melts. I needed every scent from every store. Yes, I still burn/melt them but have so many I don’t really love the smell of, and they’re just sitting in a bin... I can’t give them away though yet for whatever reason. I also splurged and got some on Etsy and won’t burn them since shipping was a lot of money... I totally know they will eventually use their scent and aren’t being used for their intended purpose, I just can’t force myself to use them. Now, the worst of all is that something I’ve been collecting for years has now become an item of such high demand (Rae Dunn anyone?). I can’t find the pieces to complete my collection anywhere. I don’t need every piece of her work, but there are pieces I am dying for and just cannot find. It’s driving me nuts. It’s also terrible since so many people are selling the items I want for astronomical prices and I just can’t afford them. It’s killing me seeing that I COULD technically have these items, but also CANT. Anyway, that was a lot of rambling. 

Basically, does anyone else have these types of obsessions? How do you deal with them? How do you draw the line between what you’d like to have in your life and what you are just buying to add to a collection? 

TLDR; I have diagnosed OCD and am collecting things because I become obsessed with having a full collection. Looking for feedback/personal stories. 

Edit: right now I live with my parents and don’t have a ton of financial responsibilities. I’m very nervous for when I have bills to pay. I CAN save money, but have a hard time once I slip back (or find a new obsession) starting to save again.

selftext: I’m a year 10 student from Australia (not that that’s relevant) and I use to get very good grades because I was motivated. I still do get above average grades but I know I can do better - I just lack the motivation. What can I do to gain motivation? 
I think it started a couple years ago when my uncle (of whom was the father of basically my only cousins that I was close with) was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and I saw the way it effected their family - especially my Aunty. 
To make matters worse, once I finally moved on, my oldest brother started acting strange. He was becoming angry and started spending insane amounts of time doing basic things like washing his hands and having a shower. He was soon diagnosed with mild OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). I know it sounds stupid what I said above and I’m afraid to share it with any of my friends as I am afraid they will mock me and won’t believe me but it’s really started bothering me and I’m losing a lot of sleep because he keeps me awake from him spending hours yelling and getting angry because he “feels dirty”. I’m doing my best to be patient and keep my feelings in. Again, it’s sounds stupid, and that’s because it is, but I just don’t know what to do. I had to vent and let this out because not even my parents believe me when I say this. They act like it’s not that big of a deal but truth is- I’m worried it is making my mum depressed too. Please give me advice so I can be happy and gain motivation. I feel like the worst part of this too is not being able to tell anybody and the fact that I feel like I’ve lost my oldest brother.

selftext: A few years ago my Dad said to me “I have finally figured out what has plagued my life all of these years! ADHD! And I think you have it too. I don’t want your life to end up like mine, please go talk to a doctor about getting diagnosed.” I was pissed, who is he to tell me what I have? Also he had lost credibility with me due to a lot of different factors. Well it’s been 2 years and He has since passed, I am now realizing how true his words were. i have so many symptoms. I had symptoms as a child but they were masked during diagnosis not do to high grades but due to not performing well. See I had weak eye muscles that caused double vision, I finally told my parents I had an issue when I was in second grade. Then I was behind in school, I’d say dream during lectures, I’d Day dream during study time. They said i had dyslexia, then when I got older “learning disabled”, something clicked in college and I was able to make amazing grades with zero modifications. I have never been able to complete tasks, keep my room clean, now as an adult keep my house tidy, I am constantly losing/misplacing things, it really bothers me when people don’t like me, or reject me, I mean I will analyze the crap out of each and everyday to find out how it went to wrong. i am quick to anger, distracted easily, sometimes I don’t like to be touched. It has affected jobs in the past and is currently affecting my relationships with my spouse and if I don’t do something about it soon it will affect my relationship with my children. I really hope the doctor takes me seriously. 

When you were diagnosed did you have to get referred somewhere or did the primary care physician give you a diagnosis? What should I expect at my appointment?

So a little background info: I live in a foster family and the man of the house is not acknowledging my diagnose. Before I got my diagnose early December last year he always kept nagging me about forgetting things, forgetting appointments, being disrespectful, inattentive etc.

So now after more than 6 months he is still behaving in the same way. He still keeps nagging me about the same things. How I'm disrespectful when I don't listen to him and when I don't remember to do everything he asks me to. He still does all of that. The only difference is that he refuses to believe that I actually have ADD. His argument is that I have decent grades in school and if I actually had ADD I would be failing classes left and right. I try to tell him that it's not the case and I actually do have problems, but he just won't understand. I try to tell him that I don't purposely ignore what he says but he wont listen. 

He doesn't realise that ADD affects me outside of school. That the reason I have a hard time staying focused when he's talking to me is not because if some stupid diagnose, but because I'm a disrespectful and mean person. 

It's just so exhausting and he's really getting on my nerves.

Once I moved to my last high school, my mood severely dropped, due to me being an outcast amongst my peers, to the point where I was crying nearly every day, even so far as to be taking Chemistry tests or Math tests bawling my eyes out. My whole attitude towards life was "what's the point". I had dreams of being a Veterinarian but my grades weren't good enough and I ended up studying Animal Science. Being in my second year at university, as well as having an improvement in my mood, my grades are looking to be high distinctions \(equivalent to an A\) and a running comment amongst my housemates is that I'm naturally intelligent. My first year of University was when I was diagnosed with BPD, but it wasn't until my second year when I decided to take my GP and psychiatrists advice and apply for DBT, however I was hospitalised quite a few times during my first year on suicide attempts.

Also ever since finding out I had BPD, it has explained why my last relationship failed, my ex\-boyfriend didn't want to deal with my mental illness. Ever since finding out I've decided not to date anyone.

I always wondered had I not suffered from BPD how much I could've had/achieved in my life?

Unlike other times where i've relapsed after a day or two, i fell very ill last week and couldn't be bothered to PMO. so i used this as a spring board to quit for good! Aside from the the blue ball feeling i've experienced once or twice my libido has completely flatlined! 
and you know what? It's amazing! 
See I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and i've struggled with hypersexuality and have relied 1-3 PMOs a day to my libido down to a normal level. 
On top of this I've been on an 8 month dryspell from sex and even though it's been my longest dry spell this flatline truely is a blessing! I noticed when I go out to bars and parties i've felt this anxiety as if people know i haven't been laid in a while. So for me to go out with friends to the bar and just hang out and have a good time feels so liberating.

TLDR 
I use PMOs to keep my sexual impulsiveness in check
Flat lining has given me the opportunity to not worry about women for the first time in my life!

PS When my libido does come back (probably with a vengence) does anyone have any advice on how to direct the energy?

selftext: When I was diagnosed with ADHD at 10 (I'm 26 now) the doctor prescribed adderall, which I did take for a while. Taking it, I felt out of it and sedated. The adderall made me not want to do certain tasks, even hobbies that I loved to do. I told my parents about it, but they did not believe me; they even faked that some of the pills were sugar pills they put in to see if I was making the side effects up. Needless to say, I stopped taking the medication and never tried different types.

Through the years, I have found ways to combat my ADHD symptoms. I am very much against letting my ADHD control my life and be an excuse. It was only recently that I have begun to discover how ADHD affects me and how I can work with it.

Looking through the internet, medication always seems to be the answer. This makes me feel like I made a terrible mistake in choosing to treat my ADHD without medicine. My question is this: Does anyone else not take medicine for their ADHD?

tl;dr Though I have tried medication, I decided the side effects were too much to handle, so I went with the unmedicated approach instead. I was wondering if anyone has done the same thing.

selftext: I'm 23F and was diagnosed with combined type ADHD in January. I've been on Concerta ever since, and at first it was incredibly helpful. I started on 18 mg, then went up to 36 for the next two months. Around the end of April the elevated heart rate side effect hadn't gone away much and it was really starting to bother me, and I was starting to get a tight feeling in my chest, as well as anxiety. It was also causing insomnia. So for May I asked for a slightly lowered dosage and got 27 mg instead. I've been taking it for about ten days now, but the side effects are still there, and I'm getting scared to take my meds now because I don't want to feel that way every day.

My next appointment with my doctor isn't until early June, a month away. The question is I don't think I can go that long without taking meds. When I don't have them my hyperactive symptoms come back with a vengeance, and I can barely force myself to do work of any kind. I'm taking classes and studying for the DAT, so I need to focus. But I can't focus when all I can think about is how my heart feels like it's about to explode in my chest. Any advice on what I should do until I can see my doctor?

My emotions have always been a little too strong and a little off the rails. As a kid my self esteem was always in the toilet, I cried at literally everything, I’d fly into a rage and yell at people. As an adult I’ve learned to stop the rage but I still bounce from giddy highs to empty-chest lows seemingly hour to hour. Add your run of the mill comorbid cocktail of depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, and you get a real fun time with feelings. Luckily I just started a DBT course and I’m hoping it helps!

When I was diagnosed in middle school they basically told me ADD was what caused me to have trouble concentrating and remembering things, full stop. The doctor gave me meds and sent me on my way. Nobody in my family learned a goddamn thing about executive function, or different presentation across genders, or strong emotions, or anything. Why the hell didn’t they tell us about anything else???

I have been struggling with mental illness for the majority of my life, and it runs rampant in my family. So far, none of my family members have ever seriously tried to get help other than me. I have a combination of C\-PTSD, mild OCD and thirdly an unsure depressive disorder\-

I was diagnosed with bipolar II in my adolescence, but recently I had a doctor tell me he thought I had major depressive disorder so severe I mistook healthy brain days for mania. 

I have been on a series of anti depressants, anti psychotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, diet changes, lifestyle changes, years of therapy and nothing is working. I've gotten my thyroid checked, all my blood levels, everything. Medicine never worked. TMS helped for a little bit, but now I'm right back where I was. Nothing is working. 

I don't know what to do. I can't keep living like this, because I'm hardly living at all. I want to live, and I want to be happy but it seems impossible. Everything in my life is looking up right now, I have no reasons to be sad.

When I was little I was diagnosed with ADHD. I have problems with studies since always. I repeated several times and I have changed twice of the race. I've always thought that I was lazy or because I did not like what I was doing. But a year ago here I realized that, even though the subject I like, I'm unable to stay more than half an hour \(being optimistic\) studying without looking at social networks, reddit, go for a walk, or just " daydreaming ". This has made me feel terribly frustrated and desperate.

I started reading testimonials from people here and decided to go to a center specialized in ADHD. On the first date I told him my personal story and they told me that I have all the symptoms and similarities with ADHD.

However, in the second appointment, I had a test of several types: retention of words, retention of numbers, retention of images \(almost all memory\). The fact is that this test lasted ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES. And I was attentive all the time. How is that contrast possible with my endurance studying at home? Do you think it is possible that having ADHD could have endured so much time attending something? Was it because of the authority figure in front of me? I honestly do not know what to think.

However, 4 or so months ago I woke up with a one of a kind (for me) sore throat and a lump (typical inflamed feeling) in my oesophagus. The latter isn't new to me, this type of feeling is how I was diagnosed with the hernia in the first place. The burning in the throat however was new.

Anyway, since then, I've had an odd feeling in the left side of my throat, next to my Adams apple. It never moves, never really goes away (apart from the first 30 mins or so in the morning where all feels normal) and it feels sort of like a cross between a burning/agitated feeling crossed with a piece of food stuck there. I also always seem to be able to bring phlegm up from this exact same area whenever I clear my throat.

I've had 5 laryngoscopes and nothing was found, had blood, swab and ultrasound tests, again, all normal.

Just wondering if anyone has had experience with LPR and thinks my issues could have been caused by acid coming up in the night, burning my throat and causing damage which has lasted me for these 4 or so months?

selftext: I thought I knew how to swim.

Through my early school years, I had always thought of myself as smart and successful. I am an EMT and ran on the local rescue squad, worked as a waitress, and was the president of HOSA at my high school. I did all this for years.

Then I went to university and the water began to rise.

I couldn't focus and nothing made sense. I was failing and I couldn't seem to make friends. I thought I was independent, but the moment I made what I thought to be a friend, I latched on and I feel excessively clingy. They are my life rafts.

Who have I become? I feel I have no personality. I strive to make my friends happy (buying them things, asking to hang out all the time, saying sorry way too much, etc). I have no hobbies. 
My ambitions have all but dissolved in the dark water I drown in when I feel the slightest bit alone. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety by the university psychologist and was put on meds.

However, all I can think about is that I'm drowning only for someone to come and save me. 

Why do I have to make things harder on everyone? Why can't I be the happy friend? The useful friend? They type who brings things to the table? The type who can swim?

selftext: Hi! so, i am Male, late 20s, around 110kg and 190 cm. Non smoker, heavy drinker and SNRI taker since around ten years.

A few weeks ago i went to my local psych ER for suicidal thoughts, general anxiety and panic attacks. They wanted to admit me but i know from previous hospital visits that admission only makes me feel shittier. So we started working on my medicine etc when the psychiatrist tests my blood pressure and it is 211/120.  So i get rushed to the cardiac ward where they keep me for a week trying to make it go down.   


Eventually i get to go home but then when i look up my chart on the internet it says i was diagnosed as having had a  transient ischemic attack which from googling seems like a minor stroke. But is that not something i would have noticed my self? I will see the cardiac people in a few days so i can ask them then what led them to write that.

I am aware my drinking and overall hectic lifestyle combined with my family history of high blood pressure probably caused the blood pressure thing. 

And i just have this general wonder that my google\-fu has not been able to answer, is high levels of anxiety and depression something that can effect your blood pressure?

selftext: I am so sick of this. I was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis weeks ago shortly after starting my first sexual relationship. I was so inflamed and itchy for a week until I got test results back and when I got the antibiotics I was so relieved, I thought the nightmare was about to be over. I thought I'd be able to have sex again and I could stop worrying about the lack of sex hurting my relationship.

Well, I was wrong. It seemed like I got better after finishing the antibiotics, just a little residual pain when I finally was able to have sex again several days after finishing the antibiotics. Next morning, it's back! I'm 1 day into another round of antibiotics but my doctor had to have that conversation with me about how even though this is so common it's notoriously difficult to treat and I just started crying and I'm just losing my shit every few hours from the anxiety.

I feel hopeless. I feel like I'm going to be one of those women that suffers for years or forever. I feel like I'll lose the person I'm with now because I won't get better or STAY better. I feel like I'll never have a normal sexual relationship. I have so much work to do since finals are happening but I can't stop worrying or crying.

selftext: I thought I was okay about being single, but today I saw something online and it really hurt my heart. I'm 27, I have HFA and wasn't diagnosed until 16. I have never had a job or relationship, I am the most socially active I have ever been but i'm still single. I don't want any sort of relationship, I want to meet someone kind, who adores me and we can spend our life together. I fear that after my mother is no longer around, I will be completely alone and lost in this world with nobody to turn to or share life with, or to look to for comfort when i'm feeling overwhelmed.

I don't understand why i'm alone, I don't think i'm ugly, i'm pretty good at masking so I don't come across as autistic \(maybe just shy\), I'm a kind person and I have a big heart. I really want to share my life with someone at my age who will hang out with me and my cat, watch movies together,talk about the meaning of life, have deep discussions and go to Disney World. I just want to be loved by someone who truly cares for me and accepts me for the unique person I am. Why can't I seem to find that person?

I'm 26/F married living in the currently not so sunny California haha I was homeschooled so it was hard to make friends because I lived in the middle of nowhere \*insert courage the cowardly dog reference\* and when I did make friends it was a small group, but I adore them. Now that I am married, I move a lot for my husbands job and I find myself alone, often. 

Sooo here we are. I could make you a list of all my likes, but I'm pretty eccentric and eclectic and I like a little bit of everything. I have diagnosed myself with Career ADHD, but that might just be the dynamic of my life. I like change, I like different, I like weird. Right now I fill my time with anime, board games, pc games, console games, comic books \(transmetropolitan, lady mechanika, bedlam, saga...\), book in general, working out, hiking, camping, cooking and taking care of my family \(the hubby and 2 very fluffy 14lb cats\). I'd like to think I'm open minded and fun, but I guess that's subjective. 

Any who, please pm if you want to chat...I'm hoping to make long term friends, so please keep that in mind. 

See ya!

selftext: Hi r/Anxiety

I finished high school in December 2015, and only started at Uni in this year in February. I took so long to start studying not because I didn't have the ability to, but because I didn't get into my university of choice. It turns out that those two years of not doing much was exactly what I needed \- I realized that I don't want to sit and do nothing ever again. It also gave me the push I needed, by realizing the anxiety I have is valid and that I need to see a psychiatrist. Previously I saw a psychologist, but it was a horrible experience that I'd like to share sometimes. Anyway, I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and, as a result of the anxiety, depression as well. I've been on medication and doing some mindful exercises, which helps immensely!

My first semester exams started on Monday \(21 May\). I haven't been in a test environment since 2015, so this is especially stressful. To be honest, nothing really helps with this added anxiety. The only thing I can do is study my best, write the exam, and then not dwell too much on it afterwards. There's nothing I can do to change the outcome after the fact. It's just a bit hard.

Sorry for the ramble! It's 7am and I'm still half asleep.

selftext: This is my first time posting here but I hope somehow this helps. 

Anyway, I’ve been struggling with what has been diagnosed as MDD for over 3 years now. After a lot of life changes, I don’t have a lot kind of professional that I see and my PCP has been deployed overseas so I haven’t been able to see him. 

My dilemma now is that my bank account has run dry and if I wasn’t living at my mother’s house, I’d be on the streets. Due to a lack of documented history of my illness, I did not qualify for disability benefits. At the same time however, I can’t work outside of my house. I don’t know if I could do online work, but I would try if I knew what to do.

The problem is that I have little energy and I don’t know where to start. I need therapy but I can’t afford it until I have an income, and my options for income are scarce until I have help. I’ve done a little research for online work but I get overwhelmed very quickly. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for, I just could use some help, whether is just positive support or if it’s resources I could use. I feel very alone and stuck and I need to start somewhere and soon.

selftext: First off, I'm under eighteen, female, and I've never drank alcohol, smoked, or done drugs in my entire life. I have no allergies and the only known medical condition I have is eczema. 
In February of 2017 I was diagnosed with mono, I ran a fever for about a month and a half. It sucked, but it wasn't that bad. By the time summer rolled around, I still wasn't back to feeling normal, but learned to deal with it. I complained to my mom occasionally, and even mentioned it to my doctor, but they brushed just it off. 

Flash forward to February of 2018, I started running a fever again, for the last year I had felt bad, but this was a lot worse. I went back to the doctor, and they thought I had reactivated mono. Well, as it turned out, it hadn't reactivated at all, I had just never gotten over it the first time. It's gotten really bad, my fever hasn't broken in three months, I can't stand up without almost passing out, I get out of breath really fast, I'm in constant pain all over my body, and I'm extremely pale. 
My doctors think it's autoimmune, because this isnt just mono, and last month they told me I had anemia. I have an appointment with a specialist, but it's still a while away. 
Does anyone have any ideas as to what this is?

selftext: I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 16. I’m 21 now. For the last few years there have been patches where it has come back for periods of time but recently I’ve been hit with a wave that just won’t seem to go away and it’s gotten to the point where I have really strong urges to self harm, mostly at night. 

The depression and anxiety seems to be a constant thing but gets worse when it’s triggered by something. These days it seems like anything and everything is a trigger, from a song to the sun shining or a place. I can’t figure out what it is but I’m tired of feeling so bad all the time. 

The desire to self harm comes mostly when I’m at my lowest. I guess as a way to release all the things I’m feeling. I don’t think I want to die, I just want it all to stop. I usually try to distract myself with a game on my phone or a tv show but those things aren’t really working anymore. 

I guess I’m wondering if anyone has any tips other than ‘go outside and be around people’ to get past this low point or how to get rid of the urges?

selftext: Hey People,

so first, i don't really know if this is a depression. I am on Prozac 30mg a day and was diagnosed with major depression some time ago. But i am still not sure if this is really a depression striking again.

I am not happy, but i am also not sad or anything. I just feel nothing. I know this ''feeling'', but it's different this time. I usually could go out with friends, watch TV/play Video Games or do something else i enjoy. This time, nothing helps. Only two things let me feel different: 


1) eating crap. Stuffing myself with unhealthy shit gives me a short ''high'' and let's me feel better. Afterwards i usually feel really guilty and get angry at myself. So i try not to eat this stuff. 

2) getting High. Kratom (if you know what it is) helps. I am not addicted, but i also don't plan to become addicted either. So i don't take it everyday. Problem right now is, i don't have anything anymore and i can't just go out to get some. 


As soon as i do one of those two things i feel, of course, better. But that's absolutly not healthy. I am just stuffing that void. Still, nothing else excites me or let's me feel again. 

What can i do guys? 

I am thankful for any help!

selftext: Hi everyone, I'm a 21 yo male, 145 lbs. I just got my CBC report back and a few numbers are off. I have high RBC, high Hematocrit, low MCH, low MCHC, and high RDW.

I suffer from sleep apnea (severe) but I'm using CPAP and usually have Apnea Hypopnea Index of around 1 to 2, which is considered pretty good.

Symptoms that I have that called for the test are:
Fatigue
Dizziness when exercising
Headache (usually happen an hour after waking up, but not directly after)

Results:
RBC - 6.00 (normal: 4.5-5.86)
MCV - 82 (normal: 79-92)
Hematocrit - 49.3 (normal: 39.4-48.9)
MCH - 24.6 (normal: 27.1-29.9)
MCHC - 30.00 (normal: 33.8 -36.5)
RDW - 17.1 (normal: 12.7-16.4)
The rest are normal

I had another report done 3 years ago (at which point I haven't been diagnosed with sleep apnea but pretty sure I suffered from it.)

Results (3 years ago)
RBC - 6.06
MCV - 78
Hematocrit - 46.9
MCH - 26.3
MCHC - 33.9
RDW - 14.8

Seems a little counterintuitive to me that RBC is still high and Hematocrit is even higher after I started sleep apnea treatment. Is it likely then that this is due to an iron deficiency? The doctor at the university clinic brushed it off and said the results aren't remarkable.


Thanks so much everyone, I really appreciate it.

selftext: All my life I've heard voices and been followed by what I call "Periphery People" or "Peri Fairy's". They kinda raised me better than my real parents (absent father, and a superficial/religiously deluded mother). But also there were the bad ones such as "Sliptongue, the Slug" (intrusive thoughts). I never wanted to talk to therapists because I "know" that if I'm officially diagnosed with schizophrenia they have the "authority" to fucking ruin my life and lock me away. Although I came to terms with mortality early in my childhood and since then I lost a lot of fear of pain and death (which fucked up my survival instincts). But also my anxiety died because nothing mattered. So I locked myself away from the outside world to keep from getting locked up (funny how that works eh). In that solitary darkness I confronted the voices and learned about what each of them are about. Then I'd give them names, faces and write their story. Every time I write about them they seem to leave me alone until they have another opinion to express. 

Anyways, after studying Analytic Psychology, Moral Philosophy, and Meditation, it turns out I have all the weapons I need to combat my demons. Didn't need drugs or anything because I'm a goddamn conquerer of self. Those wuss ass shadows don't stand a fucking chance against my powers of debate and physical control now. 

I'm just saying I've made friends with the voices now and the Pery Fairy's. But because I've been my own project for so long, I've become a hermit that's afraid of sharing my real self with friends and family because I don't want them to think I'm any crazier than they already do. I'm already intimidating enough as a noticeably confident black man in a predominantly white area with shitty psych care and mentally disabled people just littering the streets. Not to mention I'm physically fit with a natural Kubrick stare. 

I've made a persona as a chummy fun dude that doesn't take much too seriously and that seems to put people at ease around me but any time I let out a piece of my true self everyone looks at me like I'm a monster about to eat someone alive. It sucks because I love these people and they love what part of me I let them see, but I'm sure the rest of me would immediately drive them away.

So my point is, I'm at peace with my "disability" now, but who the fuck else ever will be? I gave up on any notion of romantic companionship because who could fall in love with such a terrifying presence? And one that senses imaginary entities no less...

Life is manageable, but lonely as fuck..

selftext: I've tried two rounds of counselling: One with work, and one through the private system. Neither did very much for me. They offered a lot of scattered CBT advice without actually helping me diagnose my situation or come to any kind of understanding of it. Both tried to get me to use the same useless overpriced mindfulness app.

Today, after over a year without treatment, as stuff got worse for me, I went to the GP to try and get some actual psychotherapy or something through the NHS (I live in the UK). And all I got was a referral to the exact same kind of useless counselling. 

She also mentioned the possibility of drugs, but how can I possibly start taking a course of antidepressants without first being properly diagnosed as depressed?

I don't know what I'm asking here. Just venting, mainly. It feels like there's nowhere to turn.

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD with a pediatrician, he took a lot of test ( multiple choice,..) and asked some stuff, from school and till now in uni, but is he able to diagnose other stuff other then ADHD ? Like I also have anxiety and depression , but I feel that there is someting else going on at the same time. 

I Know I have ADHD, and it explained a LOT of stuff, 

I have social problems, and I fear it might be autism spectrum, and an undiagnosed learning disability. I know ADHD does not come alone. 

On my first appointemnt with the docotr I told him that I think I have a leanring disbailty too, but he said lets worry about that later.

I think I made a post here, a while ago having trouble undersstanding humans, but at times I get in doubt because I am able to have deep converaations with people. Sometimes its hard to talk, or even beging, or soemtiems I want to say soemthing, or help soemone ,and I really want to but something prevents me from doing it.

Example. It was a rainy day, and I was raining so bad, and I had an umbrella. There was guy also standing, jsut wearing a hoody, and I felt so bad that he was getting wet. I wanted to tell come under the umbrella, but the whole time I just could not muster up the courage to just turn to him, and say "hey, come share and share my umbrella with me" Like why was it so fricking difficult.

Like I try to avoid people by putting my head down. But at times like I get
so into with people, like I doubt myself if theere is anything wrong. Its diffiuclt to have direct eye contact with people for so long, sometimes I start muttering, or sound very unarticulate. Sometiems I just speak so fast,and engaged with the person. I struggle with short talk, don't get how to start conversations, and how to end, and its weird. Also does anyone find talking to people on the phone difficult ? 

Like its depressing sometomes to think about that my whole life I sturggled with huamns, and i just can't imagine whole life. Like has anyone been able to break away from this "bondage" ?

My post was going to be about somethign else, but origanlly i just wanted to ask, is a peditircan good ? Like the doctor I went to specilizes with younger adults with ADHD, and there are not many out there . 

Anyway thanks for reading, if you were able to follow along
Thanks

selftext: So at 30, someone finally suggested I very likely ADHD. I just thought this is how everyone was, and I was just lazy and had no discipline. I thought there was something fundamentally wrong with me as a person, and  when I finally started reading it all made so much sense to me. There's so many things I do that I just thought were character flaws.

&amp;nbsp;

Clumsiness, forgetfulness, impulsive behaviors, my inability to wake up in the morning, my foot tapping/leg wiggling fidgety behavior, the constant procrastination and hundreds of unfinished projects- I originally thought it was just my inability to focus, the countless bad report cards and "very smart, just needs to apply themself" notes. It's like someone took a book of everything I'm insecure about myself and laid it out in front of me.  

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly it feels like a bit of a cosmic joke. 

&amp;nbsp;

Still, my two doctors (one is my therapist and the other my prescriber, they work in the same building) seem dodgy about diagnosing me. Even though my therapist says he's "pretty sure" and the prescriber acts like I'm drug-seeking because I didn't want to go to group therapy (UHG. NIGHTMARE.)

&amp;nbsp;

I had to basically "prove" to her I was trying to make an effort outside of medication, which is like. Yes! Medication isn't a fix-all, I know behavioral changes/mindfulness and re-learning habits is all part of it. Still, she kind of treats me like I'm a child or some kind of junkie but still prescribed me adderall anyways? I'm getting huge mixed signals. And "Why hasnt your therapist written down his diagnosis". I don't know! Ask him! He's the one that said I "scored incredibly high" on all the adhd questionnaires and tests he made me take. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's so frustrating to have that "eureka! this is what was wrong with me my *ENTIRE LIFE*" moment and still feel like the people who are supposed to be helping expect me to go full junkie. I don't even necessarily want amphetamines I just want someone to be able to say "yes this is why you are suffering". Years of self esteem issues to have a doctor look me in the face and literally say "What do you think?" and "Why are you looking to be diagnosed with this **NOW?**" feels like a kick in the face. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:** My doctors are being dodgy with me and treating me like I'm weird for seeking help at my age, can't seem to communicate with each other and it's killing my self esteem and making me second-guess myself. It's degrading as hell. Should I get new doctors or try to stick this out? It took me a long time to get this far, but this treatment makes me uncomfortable.

selftext: M/27/5’10/188lbs, though at the time 15-16/5’9/127-148lbs

Hi all and a preemptive thanks for any advice given. The tldr version is that with all the increased scrutiny surrounding head injuries and football, I’m wondering if I should be concerned about my history. 

I played 2 years of football in high school before being forced out by injuries (including concussion, detailed below). I was pretty small (127-134 lbs my first year and 145-148 my second) and played fullback/ middle linebacker so I got pretty battered up. Broken wrist, a few broken fingers, separated shoulder, etc.  I was diagnosed with one concussion, which I’ll go into below, but I had other plays where I was tackled /hit and lost vision for several seconds, had tingles in extremities, and I also had a hit to the head hard enough to break my nose in a pickup game. I did not stop play/practice for these hits. My first year, I had a fair bit of trouble getting a helmet to fit right and eventually had to order custom-sized forehead and ear pads, but prior to that, I think my head did get a bit banged up with a loose helmet. 

The play where I was diagnosed with a concussion, I can remember being hit by two helmets pretty simultaneously. Coach made me sit out after the play, so there must have been some visual clue for him that all was not well, but I don’t know if it was the hit itself or stumbling afterward or anything else. Once I got to the sideline, I realized my vision was off and had taken on a green tint that lasted probably 15-30 minutes afterward. I never lost consciousness, but I do remember afterward feeling like things that should make sense didn’t and things that should not make sense did. I had headaches bad enough to keep me from running for about a month (through the end of that football season) and have had lasting memory anomalies/problems and mood problems in the ~12 years since. (I have had voluntary psychiatric attention for mood and other psychiatric problems and tried several antidepressants, but none have had the desired effect). This was the last season I played football, with the effects of this and several other injuries starting to stack up. 

I understand that there is good evidence that CTE is extremely common in NFL players, including players (Aaron Hernandez) whose brains were examined at around my age. I also understand that a true diagnosis must be made by post-mortem examination and also that most of these players had 10 years or more to collect head trauma, while I only had 2. Lastly, I understand that concussions are linked to lasting brain injury but so is repeated sub-concussive head trauma. 

Medical attention that I’ve already received: 

At the time of the concussion, I was given a CT scan to check for bleeding in the brain. Came out clear. I remember being referred to a neurologist, but I don’t have any recollection of actually seeing one. Could be that I’ve just forgotten, or that the appointment was never made. 

I have seen a psychiatrist for problems with mood and compulsive thoughts and behavior. 

I once briefly brought up these concerns with my PCP (I was there for other reasons) and his response seemed to be “you may have lasting effects but I usually don’t refer cases like this to the neurologist because there’s not much they can do about it”. 

I guess my questions would be: 

1. How concerned should I be over one diagnosed concussion and two years of blows to the head, other than the lasting effects that I’m already aware of?

2. What benefit, if any would there be in trying to see a neurologist now? 

3. Are there any other steps I should be considering here?

Thank you.

I have my first appointment with a psychologist next week and I'll hopefully find it helpful and keep going, but I'm not sure what to expect.  

What happens during the initial appointment? What about those after?

Any insight is helpful, TY!

selftext: A family member was diagnosed as having psychosis. He believes the world is not real and is looking for "clues" to reaffirm this. He has tried to leave this "unreal" world by suicide once and still has suicidal ideations. He is in treatment, but it is quite the shock. 

We still do not know a lot as he refuses to talk about it. Is this hereditary, are other members of the family at risk? What could be causing such a state? I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

selftext: I’ve been diagnosed with femoroacetabular impingement. Four years ago I had a labral repair surgery. I’ve had persistent symptoms since then, but the symptoms are not at all limited to my hip: shoulder pain, back pain, hamstring tightness, quad tightness, groin tightness, knee pain, heel and foot pain (almost like plantar fasciitis). I believe my doctor is going to recommend a second surgery. What should my reasonable expectations be as to the relief the surgery could provide? That is, why should I expect shaving some bone to solve my hamstring tightness (etc.)?

selftext: Hi! I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression and general anxiety disorder. I also have ~some~ obsessive tendencies but haven’t been diagnosed with anything. 


For the past couple of months I have been picking at my hair absentmindedly (is that a word? Lol) and my hairline near my forehead is starting to thin. 

A few months ago, I discovered my kids had head lice (Yay for elementary aged children) Immediately after discovering this, I felt like things were crawling on my head too. My husband checked my head and I was bug free. I have very long hair and had a very bad case of lice in middle school, so I was terrified of getting it again. Anyway, I bought lice shampoo, which honestly probably made no difference since there’s now fucking “super lice” out there. I treated the kids and after a few weeks of constant combing and spraying diluted tea tree oil in all of our hair along with a few drops in our shampoo, the bugs were (and still are) GONE. 

Anyway, I pick at my scalp and run my nails down my hair constantly trying to get the (non existent) nits out of my hair. When I notice I’m doing it, I force myself to stop, but then my head starts to itch uncontrollably and I feel like I HAVE to do it. I have mild dandruff and rational me knows that’s the cause of the itching but irrational, anxiety plagued me thinks “!!LICE!! YOU HAVE THE LICE!!” I don’t know how to stop myself and my hair is suffering :( 

I have other obsessive/compulsive behaviors that I do, but right now it’s the hair. Any advice is GREATLY appreciated. TIA, lovely people of Reddit

selftext: Wanted to share a story, no particular reason why I guess. 

I was super fat a few years ago and \(not surprisingly\) I was diagnosed with high BP. Actually, I had previously been diagnosed with it when I was in the military \(also fat then\) and stopped taking my meds when I got out because reasons. Anyway, my wife wanted me to go to the doc and the doc confirmed I still had it, so I started taking my meds again. It was about a year after that when I started to develop my HA, though I don't know why. 

The doctor I had went to retired, so I had to find a new one. I ended up spending about a year losing about 100 lbs and, with the new doctor's blessing, I was able to get off of the BP meds. Sadly, that doctor transferred somewhere else so I had to get yet another doctor. 

What I actually found was a nurse practitioner. I like her, she seems to be very competent and caring \(for the most part\). At first I was irritated because I could not find an actual doctor who would take new patients. Fast forward to this week. I started to become more concerned about my heart skipping beats because my mom told me she was recently diagnosed with afib \(she is very overweight and in her late 50s\). I went back and forth for a long time but finally could not handle the anxiety of it any more and I made an appointment with the nurse practitioner to talk about it. 

When I go in to her office, I get very stressed out, but she is aware of this and it does not seem to cause any problems. She said she believes the skips are PVCs/PACs which are normal. She ordered a blood test for my thyroid and gave me a referral to a cardiologist to be sure. This happened on Thursday. On Saturday, I got a random notification from Walgreens that my prescription for levothyroxine was ready to pick up. Full blown WTF. I called the office's after hours number and talked to a physicians assistant to said my thyroid test was low, and she recommended I talk to the nurse practitioner on monday. So I call monday only to find out she doesn't work on mondays!!! She also, I was told, does not take calls but the front desk lady offered to pass along a message and call me back. Whatever. She basically told me the same thing, to take the meds and we'll test it again in a few months. I also asked about the cardiologist because they had not called me for an appointment yet. Was told that the referral got sent over that day \(four fucking days later???\). 

Here we sit, on tuesday, may 22nd. Five days after my appointment. Still no word from the cardiologist. I feel as though I do a pretty good job of controlling my HA. I have made peace with many things and although I get spun up sometimes, I can usually recover pretty well. I guess I am mostly frustrated right now at what I perceive as utter selfishness from the doctor's offices for not communicating more with me about this, knowing full well that I freak out about it. End rant.

selftext: If you are planning to attempt at killing yourself, don't.

It's not worth it.

There are 2 outcomes to killing yourself.

1. You succeed. You're dead. You leave behind a life you could possibly make better if you had tried to seek help, or leave behind the people who still love you and care about you. You spread an unimaginable sadness among a crowd, maybe a tiny crowd, maybe a crowd as large as a city. You are at peace with death, and yet you build a path for those who you never wanted to see dead. You leave behind emotional scars among family and friends, and their dreams of being with you are shattered.

or

 2. You fail. You are not dead. But you are either dying, or suffering. You start to regret your suicide attempt, if you didn't manage to put yourself into a coma. Your family and friends suffer and want to see you happy, they question you why. You start to think back as to why. Why would you do this? You are scarred, either physically, or emotionally, or both, by your attempt. You wanted to be at peace with death, maybe you still do, but you now understand the pain. The pain that comes with death. Think about it, do you want to spread that pain? No. You do not. I hope you do not.

You are worth it.

I fell into a pretty deep depression around the time my grandmother, who I called mom\-mom, had died. She had died christmas morning, 2011. I had always struggled with the fact she had cancer, and I hated every moment she was in the hospital, even before she was diagnosed. Going to her house when she was bedridden was a bore. I didn't want to see my beloved mom\-mom in a bed unable to do anything but talk to me. I was watching her fade away slowly.

I was scared for her life. And along with that, I was fearing everything falling apart. I knew something bad was going to happen. I knew it.

When she had died, it took such an emotional toll on all of us. My mom wasn't okay and wasn't really with us for a good few years, still mourning over her own mother's death. My parents started arguing and tearing apart, my mom snapped. She went to a hospital for a good while, before being diagnosed with her own illness.

My uncle, her brother, had shot up a house in Indiana due to snapping all the way. You can still find the news reports, and even the interview between the news and my grandpa. If you know about the man who ran into a house and killed a k9 unit and shot a deputy in Indiana, that was him.

He was in prison for a few good years. I felt so distant from him. Even now, with him on house arrest, he's still so distant from me. He's still lost. I'll never get him back.

Between that time, my aunt, or ex\-aunt, had started to show her true colors. She hated me. I loved her so much and she hated me. She faked loving me. She used me.

I, at the age of 12, consumed several pills and went to bed.

I woke up the next day.

I didn't tell anyone about it.

My family moved to a trailer, and then to another house. I moved to another school, a horrible school. I didn't feel like myself then. I graduated and went on to middle school, and I wasn't myself.

I befriended some people I shouldn't have. Some of those people, the good ones, are still my friends, though, and have helped me through some dark times.

The school knew of my suicidal thoughts and tried to take me away from my parents.

I grew more depressed.

A girl in the 8th grade attacked me. I was given death threats. I was treated like garbage. She tried to jump me.

I attempted again.

I woke up.

No one knew.

In the 9th grade, my anxiety started to show and I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. I don't have medication, they fear me getting addicted. I don't have a therapist.

Drama started again.

I attempted again. For the last time.

Maybe.

I told friends about it. Only a small few cared.

The school year ends in June, I'm almost a junior.

I fear I'm probably going to attempt again.

I hope I don't succeed.

I like living, I love living. I love.

Please, don't attempt. Ever.

You will regret it. You will learn to love life, I know you will.

I hope you do.

You don't deserve to die. No one does. Not the people who don't deserve it.

Please.

selftext: Both of us have been diagnosed with depression/anxiety. My diagnosis was over seven years ago. I went to therapy and took medication. Eventually I felt like I had the tools to continue on my own and since then the dark cloud that was my depression is more of a light fog that drifts in and out. However, my partner is newly-diagnosed (~two years) and has been taking medication for anxiety.  
  
For the past 18 months or so their symptoms have gradually worsened. The doctor has continued to increase the dosage of their medication to the absolute max. Initially it helped immensely, but now it's clear the medication is no longer effective. The illness has taken over every aspect of their life. They refuse to call the doctor; they refuse to look for a therapist or engage in therapy of any kind; they rarely leave the house and sleep a LOT; they have begun self-medicating with alcohol for lack of a clear path to treatment. I am beyond sick with worry and I'm afraid of going to family because, as an extremely guarded person, they would probably become very upset if it was discovered that I reached out.  
  
This is not about me, but I feel so alone and helpless. I don't know what to do. THEY NEED HELP. Have I done all I can? At some point there's nothing I can do unless they make the decision to help themselves. My fear is that decision will never be made.
  
Thank you if you have taken the time to read this. I'm desperate for any support, feedback, or resources.

selftext: I was diagnosed with GAD 10 years ago. I’ve been on 20mg cipralex(lexapro) for 6 years. Note I’m asking you guys for some insight so I can take some new ideas to my doctor-I’m not just trying to self diagnose. 

Sometimes I can be fine. More than fine, great. No anxiety symptoms, no depression symptoms, just a regular person. I’ll be like this for months. Happy and relatively carefree. Then suddenly I get hit seemingly out of the blue with paralyzingly anxiety. Can’t eat, sleep, leave the house etc. Constant nausea and diarrhea. Weird hot flashes throughout my body. Spiralling thoughts, body shaking, perceived trouble breathing, every task I have to do throws me into mini panic attacks. I have terrifying intrusive thoughts. It’s so so scary and lasts all day. When it first started happening I would go days without eating and barely drinking-now I know to force it. Still I find myself weak and dizzy, I’ve tried countless coping strategies but none seem to help, I just continue living in this  hell. Then suddenly, a few days to a week later (max 2 weeks), I’m randomly back to my old happy self. 

This doesn’t make sense to me. I go from 0 to 100 with no known trigger, randomly throughout the year. I’m in the middle of an episode right now and it’s so terrifying-I’m convinced I’m not too far from being committed or something. 

Anyone have any insight? I plan to go see my doctor as soon as I work up the courage to call and make an appointment. 

Thanks.

selftext: Also posted in r/bipolar apologies if not allowed- but I am diagnosed with both- 

So- I’m diagnosed bipolar with psychotic tendencies and borderline. 
A lot of times I’ll have an episode that I can’t control but I can kind of think back on and remember some of the embarrassing shameful things I’ve said or done. 
But sometimes it’s much worse... for example
I was opening up to my partner about some very dark childhood trauma I went through- I thought I would be ok telling him- but I was wrong. It was such a massive trigger that my brain completely shut down... I guess I was acting out- acting crazy- upsetting him- and I don’t remember any of it. NONE OF IT. I disappeared for awhile- I guess texting my brother who suffers all the same mental issues- I don’t remember texting him either- i reread my text the next morning and wow- I was on one.... 
does this happen to anyone else? How do you deal? How do your partners help you?
I’m so in love with this person- but I know he won’t be able to handle these episodes I have forever- I’m so afraid I’m going to scare him away- cause why the hell would anyone stick around when I completely lose control of myself and have big black gaps in my memory....it’s upsetting for me- but I know it has to be so much worse for someone watching from the sidelines....he’s been very sweet and supportive- but it’s not his responsibility to calm my ass down. I just feel so so very shitty. I just want a normal brain...

selftext: Hello! Thank you for reading this. I’m a 23 year old female, 5’8” and 150 lbs. I have been diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and have a family history of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. Recently I had an ANA test done, which came back as a low-positive for both speckled and homogenous, although my doctor is unsure of what, if any, condition is causing this. I also had eczema when I was a child on my arms, and was diagnosed with vaginal lichen sclerosus around the age of 8.

My original symptoms involved the skin on my vulva becoming white, hard, paper thin, and very painful. I would often get microtears on the skin that would bleed; the whole area sometimes burned. I was put on a steroid cream, which helped but did not completely remediate the condition. It resolved itself when I hit puberty, as the doctor said it would.

I haven’t had many issues since then, until recently. For a couple years, I’ve noticed that after having sex, my vagina would often burn, both on the inside and around the vaginal opening. Sometimes this pain was severe and I had to lie down for a while. I assumed this was because of sensitive skin and chafing so I wasn’t concerned until now. I have now developed two small pinhead-sized bumps on my vulva, one on the inner upper labia majora and one on the outer lower part. Of course at first I was concerned that it was an STI, but the bumps have not opened up and formed blisters, nor do they appear to be warts. There are only two and are not clustered. One bump started out as red and swollen but reduced in size within a few hours. It is sore and hurts to the touch. The other bump has a white line running through it, which is what lead me to lichen planus. Right now, my whole vulva has a minor burning sensation, very similar to the pain I experience after intercourse. It was also slightly itchy in the week leading up to this. I have tested negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea and do not have a history of STIs.

While researching lichen planus i came across pictures of large, flat red bumps that form on other parts of the body. About two years ago I started getting bumps that looked exactly like the pictures, were very itchy, would get larger over time, and lasted over a month. Recently I developed another patch on my chin that took two or three months to clear up. I’ve attached pictures of the first two instances, which were the worst:

https://imgur.com/a/OZHJCEM

So my question is, is it possible for a person with a history of lichen sclerosus to develop lichen planus, or are the two conditions similar but unrelated? Does this sound like lichen planus? I plan on seeing a dermatologist but I have seen several doctors in the past about the lesions on my arm and chin and nobody could figure it out. My initial diagnosis for lichen sclerosus took a while to figure out (as it is rare for children to develop) so I’m looking for a starting point for when I find a dermatologist.

selftext: I know it’s hard to diagnose someone from online but I thought I would give it a shot. Riad is someone I’ve known (online) since about October. I found him because he was a “meme” within my online group of friends. Basically he’s the self proclaimed “World President” of “The New world Order” he’s dead set on believing he’s world president. He has thirty thousand instagram posts, all of almost the same pictures with a different filter (I’ll attatch images). He also really believes he’s good friends with political figures like John Mccain and Donald Trump. He’s 100% convinced that he is the “ruler of this world” and owns “all beautiful woman”. Thats another thing is, his twitter is filled with retweets of like “sexy lady” accounts. His speech is kinds screwy on text and he has some sort of accent, in texts he doesn’t bother with full sentances but in videos he will. When agitated, he’ll tell people they will “be fired from the NWO”. While some people have tormented Riad, I’ve been really nice to him over the months, but I really would like to know whats up with him. I don’t know of any fairy active diagnosing sub reddits, so I’ll ask this here because I believe he may have a very severe case of schizophrenia. I can’t figure out how to attatch things below for you to look at, I’ll post them seperately, tell me what you think. And if you find his account, please do not harass him. Thank you, God bless.

selftext: Ok, this is my life in a nutshell. I am 22 years old and life is stressful with college and family. Where do I begin? I was diagnose with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Wow, those are a lot of problems. I struggle to commit suicide because I have a twin brother and an older sister, their combine love basically keeps me going at this point. I also have a group of friends who I can talk to on a personal level. I bite my nails constantly, it is one of my bad habits. I used to get bullied at school but now that I am in college, bullying is almost nonexistent (thank god). Anyways, college has been stressful because of the work load. My major is computer science and gpa is 3.1. Basically after the first semester, I do well but on the second half, I run out of steam. How can I maintain stamina through out the entire year? I guess my best solution is to go to the gym and get rip at my college campus. 
...
Now here is my problem with family. When I was young, I always had a problem of people putting me down. My dad is a jerk but I still have to respect him. I used to get beat so often that I became a  living zombie. I try to build a father and son relationship with him, but this man is stiff as a brick. I eventually get good mornings from him during the daytime, but thats about it.
My mom loves me and my two sibling a lot. However, when it comes to parenting (advice giving) it's abysmal. I love my mom a lot but my god she has got to leave her mother's wing. I think she is 51 years old and still lives with her mother who is 74 currently. At some point in time folks, you got to leave your parents wing.
...
My grandmother is the chef of the family. The house we live in her house. Now, there is a huge problem when the house you live in is run by a dictator. She is manipulative, ignorant, and a mosquito on my mood. I try to show as much affection to her as possible but I feel like all I am doing is massaging her ego. This is my mom's mother. The two of them are extremely close.  My mom sleeps in grandma's room and not in the room with her husband (the man she supposedly married) but I digress. My dad constantly boast about how she is a horrible parent. He is right. Because the next person on the list is her son or in other words my uncle. 
....
My uncle lives with us now. I think he is 50 years old. He had run into some trouble with the law multiple times and had to serve jail time. He also has 4 children with two different women and unemployed. He failed to pay child support. Now this man, hate, and I mean HATE his sister (my mother) and his mother (my grandmother) for numerous reasons, that I am not going to get into because its such a long list of bull shit. Anyways, this man loves degrading my mom and if you have an opposing viewpoint he would degrade you too. We got in a fight, which wasn't much of a fight because I easily got overpowered. I will admit, I was stupid to confront him but that's not all, the man that self invited himself into our house put an order of protection on me and my mom. I feel bad for the stress that is putting on my grandmother. We have to go to family court. I wasn't completely truthful on the description for the order of protection. To be honest it was my mom who forced me out of bed to file the order of protection. This stress draining on the body, mind, and soul. The sad thing about it, I put myself in their death triangle. 
....
My cousin and my family obviously shared some bad blood. He refers
my family members as pigs and bitches, lowest of the low. This didn't
really bothered me at first, however he would call me on a daily basis just to know what I am doing. I didn't mind at first but it got to the point where he would dictate how I should live my life. If there was one word I had to think of that would explain my relationship in one word, it would have to be suffocating. It felt as if the way how I lived my life wasn't up to his standards. I am an introvert, he is an extrovert to the extreme. Sadly, we live in a world where people have all the answers for others but none for themselves.
...
I am far from my perfect self. I took my anger out on social media, and lost a friend and family. It just felt so addictive to expel all that anger, however it almost seemed as if I was trying to look for pity from other people or someone who can answer my cry for help. I hate being angry because it not only hurt yourself but those around you. Perhaps I should just go to a homeless shelter just to get some peace of mind. I really want to have my own place for myself, work with a big tech company and have a dog (helps with depression).
Anyways what is your thoughts on my situation?

selftext: **TL;DR: I went to see a neuropsychologist for a dyscalculia assessment intake appointment and I felt like my ADHD diagnosis was being threatened. I don’t know what to do. Help!**

I went to see a neuropsychologist for a dyscalculia assessment intake appointment today. I have always had difficulty with math and I had been in special education until middle school for it. It never amounted to anything though… I still can’t remember basic math facts like multiplication tables or read analog clocks. I’ve gotten around this with accommodations for ADHD. I’ve been allowed memory aids \(formula sheets &amp; calculator\) as a working memory accommodation. With that accommodation I get A’s in classes like calculus and statistics because it’s not the concepts that I have trouble with but the computation and math fact recall. However, this accommodation is the one that gets scrutinized by ableist professors that think I’m trying to cheat or think that ADHD isn't real … Hence, my search for a dyscalculia diagnosis. I’ve also just been admitted to university from community college so I am feeling a sense of urgency around this.

So anyway, the intake appointment went very strange. She had a lot of negative things to say about how psychiatrists diagnose ADHD. It seemed like she was intending to overturn my ADHD diagnosis in favor of a learning disability diagnosis which made me really uncomfortable. I gathered all of my medical records, all of my transcripts, my old IEP stuff like she asked. Everything. She didn’t look at any of it. She implied that my questions about the nature of the testing would be answered after I made the assessment appointment and paid her for it. She insisted upon their rigorous scientific validity, but didn’t cite anything to back up such a claim, nor what the tests were called. She mentioned IQ though, and I asked if IQ tests were legitimate… She said they were highly accurate. This gave me pause. She also suggested that I should be very careful about who I give the report to… She said that I shouldn’t disclose to an employer that I have a disability. This also gave me pause, since I know you can’t legally get accommodations without disclosing. She also asked me to not take my ADHD medication for the test, which I thought was weird. She also made an odd comment about the type of medication I was on.

The thought of my ADHD diagnosis being taken away from me really scares me. I was diagnosed as an adult \(many years ago now\) by a psychiatrist that specializes in ADHD and I have never had any psychiatrist question it since then. I don’t function when I’m unmedicated, and I felt like she was trying to take my meds and legal rights away.

I’m not sure what to do. Should I try to see someone else for a dyscalculia assessment? How do I get someone to diagnose a comorbidity and not overturn my ADHD diagnosis? Or should I just hope that I don’t run into any trouble at Uni regarding my working memory accommodations?

I have recently been putting myfocus back on my art and exercise and things that use to bring me happiness but I mostly find my self sitting in a room having a panic attack or mental breakdown.  Any advise or support on how to treat with out medications.

selftext: I've never been diagnosed with depression but I am pretty sure I have the full symptoms. For the past 5 years my life has been going downhill and in the last year I've actually worked on myself a bit. School and gym helps. Gym Specially, I feel like a brand new dollar bill after a workout but I never quite feel happy. Even though I feel good about my body, I hate others simply because they can feel happy. Dunno if I can even feel happiness at this point but narcissm will do it for now.

I’m learning how to control my emotions, I’m slowly learning how differently my brain processes information and that is helping but I am still causing pain in my loved ones because I’m so damn selfish - of course I fail to even process my actions that way. How do you think or what do you do to try and not be selfish?  My loved ones feel they aren’t even a part of my equation.

Recently there’s been real dark periods were despite my usual outgoing self I have a feeling where any sort of interaction bothers me. This is usually coupled with a real heavy sadness that follows with everything else. So I wanted to ask my favorite community if anyone had any tips for handling this darker periods of times as it sometimes ends up hurting my friendships as I tend to isolate myself.

selftext: I’ve just finished University, and my final year has been filled with stress and I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety. Now that I’ve finished, and got nothing to stress about I find myself constantly worrying about my health. 

My anxiety is largely physical issues. I get chest pains, palpitations, stomach cramps etc. but every small issue with my body, such as a simple rash or cut, I start to just assume the worst, that it’s cancer or something as equally life threatening. 

Is there anyone who has similar thoughts and feelings, and if you do, how do you deal with it?

This is a documentary to raise awareness that having a mental disorder doesn't mean you can't be the best you that you can be.  I highly recommend.  A trial exists for those without Showtime but still want to watch.

Over the last two months my hands (primarily my finger tips) are pruning and wrinkling. It began on my left thumb but is now on all my fingers. It’s not itchy or irritated, however the tightness of the skin is uncomfortable. I have not changed anything in my routine and haven’t exposed myself to any harsh chemicals. I have been moisturizing every day, but it doesn’t have any affect. Even when I visited a nurse practitioner she wasn’t able to diagnose this. 

Any additional info will help.

selftext: I'm 30, just diagnosed with ADHD while I've previously had diagnoses of Depression/Anxiety. I was just prescribed Adderall, 5 mg to start with, and I'm on my second day taking it. It's given me a ton of energy and helped curb my executive dysfunction, which is great, but I have some minor concerns. 

My main question is: how long do I need to take it before I notice changes in 1\) my ability to concentrate, and 2\) changes in my appetite? Both of these things remain the same as they were before, and I worry that means it's not going to work for me, because I've noticed a lot of people reporting that they immediately have hyperfocus and little to no appetite. 

On a related but similar topic: I'm traveling out of the country \(I'm a US resident, travelling to the UK\) in a month; because it's such a highly\-regulated drug, do I need to carry anything special with me in order to travel with it? 

Thanks in advance, and I hope I'm not repeating questions that have been asked here already.

The only relatives I have that I can ask are either dead or demented beyond asking or not willing to talk about it (mother). I have no idea what I'm meant to do. I was originally diagnosed with fibromyalgia but now after combing the limited info on the internet this makes so much more sense.

I was born 8 weeks premature in 1985 with water in the brain. My parents were told to take photos and say goodbye. That's all I know ... And I've been mostly healthy until 18 months ago when I started having seizures, migranes and general motor issues. It's destroying my life. I can barely work and I can't do anything about disability cos the doctors can't agree what is wrong lol. 

So if anyone knows anything I'd love to hear it! I do not have epilepsy. Beyond that who knows.

selftext: In January I seemingly injured myself during a warm-up set deadlift. After initially being diagnosed with a sprain, following an X-Ray it was later diagnosed as Minor Sacralisation on the left side of my Lumbar Vertabrae (which is seemingly pinching a nerve causing leg pain/discomfort). Since then I have avoided the gym/running/exercise on the doctor's recommendation (I have been walking plenty to take the edge off).

I have my first physio session on the 5th of June but as I'm eager to start training again I was wondering what sort of recovery period I should be expecting for this?

Will I be able to start light training at least before full recovery?

I don't know which info is relevant  so I'm a 29 year old caucasian man, no previous injuries beyond a few muscle sprains here and there, 5'11 around 12 stone 10, prior to injury I have been very active for the last 5 years or so (gym/run 6-7 days a week, endurance courses, climbing, MMA).

selftext: Hi everyone.. needed a place to put these things down because lately I’ve felt very isolated and stuck in my head. 
Every now and then I have these spells where I’ll go on a bender for 1-2 weeks. During that bender I’ll get back on tinder and hook up with a couple random guys, drink almost every night to the point of black out (or during the day), and stop doing school work. I’m about to graduate and since I just went through a week long spell of BPD I’m a little behind in work and ashamed of my behavior. Anyways, after the bender I’ll sit alone at home for a few days just disgusted and anxious. I can’t sleep. I feel nauseous. 
Another thing is during these spells I will dissociate a lot more. I’ll look at my belongings or my name on paper and in my head think “That’s not me. I’m not this person.” Like I’m trapped in someone else’s body for a few moments. 

I’m just scared of these episodes I have. I was diagnosed with BPD back in high school but once I graduated and matured a bit I never noticed them until a year ago when they started happening (there’s been 3 since then spaced out across the months). It seems like whenever I get out of a relationship I will have these spells. 

I’m just not sure what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

For quite some time I’ve had weekly bought where I find bright red blood on my toilet paper. Very rarely if ever do I notice it in the toilet or on my stool. Today however I noticed something very red in my stool (which honestly could’ve been from food I’ve eaten but am not sure). My doctor is sending me in for a colonoscopy but believes my bleeding to likely be from either hemorrhoids or a fissure. Because I’m freaking myself out and convincing myself I have anal cancer I decided to take a look at my anus and I honestly don’t believe it looks very healthy. Would like a doctors thoughts on this however.

Thoughts?

To add I have absolutely no family history of cancer with the exception of my paternal grandfather who was diagnosed with mouth cancer (used to chew tobacco) and prostate cancer in his 80’s.

Thoughts? I know it’s not a pleasant sight to have to look at, but would appreciate any info I can get. Further more I understand most doctors here are donating their time and expertise. I’m willing to donate to a charity of the doctor who replies first’s choosing as long as they have an honest medical opinion to share.

selftext: So I was diagnosed with ADD in November and have been taking adderall XR since then. For the first few months I was on 5mg, then went up to 10mg at the start of spring semester, and then went up to 15 about a month and a half ago. About a month ago I noticed that I was breaking out in hives and assumed it was one of the newer medicines/supplements I was put on for insomnia and anxiety so I stopped taking those for about a week and only stayed on my adderall but the hives didn’t go away and now have a small rash on my neck. I have also been experiencing shortness of breath with adderall and my adderall XR has only been lasting about 2-4 hours (which I initially thought was just my tolerance going up - and it still could definitely be that - but I’ve only been on 15mg for about a month and a half and that seems extremely quick for my tolerance to go up and for the effects to be that severe), and , while I usually do not experience comedowns in any form, my comedowns have become extremely bad to the point where I feel “staticky” and am hit with an extreme wave of fatigue to the point of not being able to even hold a conversation. Could I have become allergic to adderall even though I wasn’t when I started it?

Please don't be sad for me, I have lived a life that many will never experience. I have seen the world, I have raised two successful children, I have been in love and I have fought in war. What else is there? The thought of finally ending my nightmares, and slaying my demons actually brings me hope. 

This wasn't a decisions that was reached easily or spur of the moment. Sine 2005 after being diagnosed with sever PTSD and i have struggled with it. The thoughts have all ways been there, but only as a fantasy, I never thought about acting on it until these last few months. In the last 90 days I lost my job, have been denied benefits from the VA, denied Unemployment, been denied welfare and food stamps. and now I will be homeless within 12 days (at least I can sleep in my truck until its repossessed). And yes I have tried all these organizations that are supposed to help veterans but (as you can guess) i have been denied from those as well. 

Anyways that's all. I wish everyone well and enjoy your life (as much as you can), its way to short not to take a chance or to try new things. I am just tired. So very tired.......

selftext: I was diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid. I didn't know what that meant until I was older and started reading about it. I noticed a lot more parallels with my dad than with me. This provides an explanation about how he is. All my life, I had to learn to ask him very specific questions, because with even an ounce of metaphor, we would take it literally and get confused. Growing up, I could understand what someone was saying if they were using figurative language but by dad always took it literally. We always thought he was being a smartass but this makes a lot more sense. I also have noticed that if I was upset or scared of something, he didn't really know what to do. I have emetophobia, which is a severe irrational fear of vomit or vomiting. This has resulted in innumerable panic attacks and he has never empathised. Sometimes, if my mum is upset, my dad doesn't really understand what's wrong so I'll go in and listen to her and help her. He is also very set in his ways and doesn't like to try new things. For example, I chose a Thai restaurant for my birthday dinner this year. He thought everything sounded weird and he ordered the one thing on the menu that he was used to getting at a Chinese place. There are foods he refuses to try because they "sound weird".

I am still well under 30, have a wonderful social life, hold a decent job, and am pursuing a masters or PhD. However, I've been diagnosed and struggled with OCD and other supposed personality disorders which have led to a host of narcotic addictions for years. With each passing day over the past decades I've increasingly lost the ability to make rational decisions to the point that my future feels predetermined and bleak. The universe would be better off if the energy used for my existence were used elsewhere: maybe as fuel for microbial life or some other unpredictable purpose. I feel the need for the universe to reach it's most entropic state, and I am forbidding that state by my very existence. Despite years of therapy and numerous prescriptions, my frustration and unhappiness are growing at a pace that indicate joy and peace of mind are not in my future. I've given myself a few more years to trudge through the progressively deeper swamp of existence in hopes my feelings are in fact ephemeral. To those who have felt similarly, has life been worth the anguish or should I egregiously enjoy my last few years and a final cocktail? I am not at risk of suicide in the near future, and I am receiving professional help. I would like suggestions for psychological betterment

I've always had a problem with late/missing work, but now that it's finals week at my university, where turning in my papers is actually important, I still seem to shut down and be unable to finish anything I start. 

I'm just so frustrated right now as I've have a whole portfolio due tonight by midnight (which isn't even close to done) and all I've been doing all day is watching stupid youtube videos and random chores. I also have an entire essay due a week ago today in Spanish that I haven't even attempted to begin. Like, why am I like this??? 

And I can't go to any of my friends to talk about my issues when it comes to school because they all tell me to "just focus and do your work", as it works for them because they're all really good at school with close to 4.0 GPAs.

I have taken the eye drops everyday since being prescribed them and have encountered no issues.

She caught feelings really fast, like within 2 days she was worried she said that she would say the L word. She told me she is super clingy and so far she is with messages saying she hopes I'm alright if I take too long to message. 

Everything in her life according to her is negative. She says her aunt claims she is a hypochondriac. She says she has a lot of health problems, she claims her grandma and everyone is mean to her and won't feed her. Everyday she's got some kind of illness or someone is mad at her. Everyone she has dated has been abusive, with one causing her a miscarriage. She claims her ex husband was super religious and wouldn't have sex with her, that she had to force him to on their honeymoon and they never did again the whole 2 years of marriage. 

She told me one night she was scared because she was hallucinating, but that she knew it wasn't real, but that it still scared her. She says she had a lot of trauma in her childhood from her biological dad. It just all feels so weird. We've known each other for 2 weeks and she's already clung to me hard and wants a long future together.

selftext: I'm 24 and recently realizing that a lot of ASD symptoms resonate with how I've always existed in the world, and was hoping to compare notes with people who know the ropes. In no particular order:

-I have always needed structure, threw myself into extracurriculars in school, and never played hooky because it felt horrible to not know what I was supposed to be doing. Today I skipped a weekly meeting and came close to a panic attack.  

-Loud music seems to physically hurt me, especially when I'm tired. Similarly, the noise of fire drills greatly distressed me as a kid.  

-I don't have trouble making acquaintances but it's really hard for me to make close friends.  

-Social group dynamics, especially group chats, are super stressful for me, so I've never been able to comfortably be part of a "friend group".  

-When people say "we should hang out" I assume we're going to hang out within the next week. (This is not usually true.)  

-I've always felt a bit different/off, like I wasn't quite on the same wavelength as everybody else or like I was missing something that everyone else seemed to understand intuitively.  

-I was diagnosed with OCD as a kid and have had obsessive anxiety since age 10, now mostly controlled by medication, but it feels related and has usually centered around impulse control and social dynamics.  

Does this resonate with anybody? Comments welcome!

selftext: This is hard to explain without doing a course in psychology and being familiar with their terms.

I haven't been diagnosed with autism and most probably not one.

I feel like the higher thinky part of my brain is not bound all that closely with the feely primal part of my brain.

As an example I can clearly recognize that I'm anxious but I have no reason why. It took me years to actually come to the reason of my anxiety.

I'm afraid of heights by the thoughts going through my head are not "This is dangerous and i'm going to die" but rather "I seem to be afraid of heights and nothing else". 

I'm a bit socially anxious but when my therapist asked whether the thoughts going through my mind were "I am not good enough for these people" I answered honestly that thoughts never came across my mind but I can feel discomfort in those situations.

I'm most of the time emotionally unmoved by anything but when I am I get completely obsessed with it for many days and then return back to normal.

My fear response is mostly muted. Usually choose fight over flight in fantasies and a bit in real life. Have noticed that I am bolder and have done things with I feel that my peers are afraid to do. 

I imagine that normal people bind thoughts to most feelings and replay the thoughts when the feelings reoccur.

I tried talking but I didn't manage to form a choerent sentence, I had to repeat the same sentence multiple times to get it rght and would make mistakes during speaking even though the sentences formed in my head. It's gone now, this happened 10 minutes ago about. What's going on?

Update: I got to the hospital where they ran some checks and I got an infusion, everything went fine. They sent me up to a room to checked on me through the night and now I'm waiting for a doctor to see me. They took blood samples, CT scanned me, took a Urin sample, checked my heart rate and pulse, additional a neurological inspection was made stating my physical ability wasn't impaired and my mental health is sound. Hoping to go home soon and to find out what it was.

Update: I have just been released from the hospital after staying there overnight until now (15:35). I'm well and have been diagnosed as having migraines with an aura, this isn't the official term or diagnosis yet, I will receive it through the mail soon. I've been prescribed medicine against migraines and need to see my personal doctor about further health issue, treatment and prevention.

I Binge and Purge everyday and it has gotten SIGNIFICANTLY worse since I got sober from cocaine. Most Coke addicts just love the high and that's why they do it... Well I do it specifically to lose weight. I went to a treatment facility where I was diagnosed with PTSD from January - March and while I was there I was (obviously) sober and my eating disorder manifested into a life of it's own. I went from 107 pounds to 119 pounds in 59 days. I was followed to the bathroom by staff to make sure I didn't Purge. Well now that I'm out I have gone up to 129 and all I can do (besides apply for jobs and go to CA meetings) is obsess over my body. It's gotten so bad that I finally relapsed on drugs because I told myself "I will just use enough to drop the weight then I'll quit" 
Hold up wtf an I doing? I know I'm SABOTAGING myself but this mental obsession with my body is loud! I can't even look in the mirror or take a shower without wanting to cry! I love the way I look when I'm skinny but DAMNIT I don't want to feel the way I did before when I was using...

Especially since I've had to wait a month between my intake meeting with the therapist who is actually going to treat me and my first actual appointment. It's going to be next week, but the past month has just been really hard. And especially over the last few weeks I've noticed that I'm not really taking care of myself. I've been doing a lot, going to uni and even extra curricular stuff. But I haven't been eating properly. Not enough food, not enough vegetables. Even right now, I know I should get dinner, but I just can't bring myself to get up and cook, or even go and get take out. I'll be good for a few days, but then it just falls apart. Most days I don't eat lunch. I just don't know how to motivate myself to do it. I've literally just joined reddit a few minutes ago because all of my support people are asleep on the other side of the world or busy on this side of it. And plus, whenever they hear about this stuff they freak out and I don't want to worry them. I just want someone to take care of me and make me food and I feel so very whiny about that, but it's true. This BPD thing is hard. Anyone else get this?

She isn't abusing me, not at all, but she does yell at me quite a bit, mainly because of my depression, as well as the fact that I'm currently questioning my gender identity (I think I might be transgender, but she thinks it's "just a phase" because I have Asperger's). 

Another reason is because of my little brother and little sister. It doesn't happen all the time, and they still love me despite this, but they like to gang up on me (even though I'm 3 years older than the both of them). They mainly pull my hair and kick/punch me (my little brother does that quite a bit). I'm really embarrassed because of this. I'm 3 fucking years older than them, and I could beat the shit out of them if I really wanted to, and I've tried to fight back, but I always get in trouble when I try.

Ugh, why am I talking about this like it's abuse? It's nothing like that.

Anyways, I've planned how I might kill myself (either slitting my throat or wrists with a razor), but I don't know if I really should or when I'd even do this. I'm really ashamed to be posting this online, but I feel like it's the right thing to do... I'm hoping for some support.

selftext: I wanted to share something positive with you guys. I saw the pdoc Friday and explained I thought I had ADHD on top of bipolar. I was taking Zyprexa and Lamictal for bipolar, and Mirapex for akathasia. I showed her a list of 35 symptoms I had written on my iPad. She considered it and diagnosed me with comorbid ADHD and bipolar 1. She added Strattera and gabapentin to my med list. After two days, it was like I was transformed. The constant anxiety of work disappeared. I was able to come in on time in the mornings and stay until I was supposed to leave. I stopped talking a million miles an hour. I was able to walk the dog for an hour without agonizing over how far I would be from home. I prayed with my wife and went to church instead of feeling anxious that I wasn't being a good Christian. I resisted pornography for the first time successfully in months. I did schoolwork, I focused on tasks and stayed organized. I stopped spending money and seeking new things constantly. My temperament became mellow and easy\-going. I started sleeping far better. I was able to make it through movies without having to check my phone or stop watching.

I don't know which medication did it, but it's a fucking miracle. Just a note to keep pushing for the right meds and diagnosis guys, relief is possible!

selftext: Hi fellow Redditors.


I am wondering whether anyone has any advice/suggestions that could help me with my chronic illness.

I am a 26 year old male in Australia, and have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, which I have been managing for over 2 years now. This diagnosis is by no means conclusive – I think it's just what doctors use to label this sort of illness when they don’t know what it is. 


My symptoms include:

- sore eyes (ie mild burning, sore to move, sensitive to light);

- headaches;

- hot and cold flushes, and poor temperature regulation;
- fatigue and low energy;

- diarrhoea;

- swollen glands under my chin and around my neck;

- mildly foggy vision; and

- other flu-like symptoms.


The things that tend to set off these symptoms include:

- lack of sleep (I usually need 9+ hours);

- physical activity / exercise (I have practically eliminated all exercise from my lifestyle); and

- stress.


It is possible that my illness was initially triggered by blue-green algae exposure, but I have no previous illnesses or medical history of note.

I have seen a whole host of health professionals (including various GPs, a chronic fatigue specialist, naturopaths, a neurologist, an acupuncturist etc.) without any success. I have taken various forms of medications to try and treat this to no avail. I'm not taking anything currently.

If you have any information or advice that you think might help, it would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you so much in advance!

selftext: I have traits of anxiety, depression, and some other mental issues, but not a formal diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with a form of emotional PTSD due to early childhood trauma so I think a lot of my issues stem from that. I just want to share what I realized in hopes that it could help someone else.

I titled this note "Self Diagnosis":

*Anxiety fuels depression. I have to control my surroundings and I take action on my anxiety. I don't consider the long-term consequences of my actions because I feel like I'm drowning and I'm doing everything to survive. The more short-sighted steps I take the deeper into the dark forest because I'm too busy fighting and I cannot plan accordingly.

I long for intimacy, but ultimately cannot be in a healthy, proper relationship because I let my past experiences dictate my current actions. I find broken people like me and I manipulate them as a means to make me feel like I'm loved and when I have a flare up of abandonment, I abandon before I can be abandoned.

I feel like an oxymoronic because I have self-esteem in some places or my life, but feel like a total loser in others. I have friends and I make decent money and have a decent career, but my marriage is garbage and I'm failing to show my daughter how she should be loved by showing her example of my failing marriage.*

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADD as a kid, and used it off and on for a couple of grades growing up. 
Fast forward to today (in my 30's), I have my own online business, and I realized I need some extra help to keep myself focused and productive, and to keep my brain from beginning to shut off and refuse to work at around noon every day. So I got a Ritalin prescription, and I've been taking 1-3 10mg pills every workday (spaced 4 hours apart), depending on how long I work or how demanding the job is.
 
In any case, every time I have very large and demanding projects, I end up getting sick. It feels like I am working myself sick, and I suspect that the added energy boost from Ritalin is robbing from my immune system reserves or something. I haven't seen anybody else bring up the topic online, so I might as well ask.

I should probably also add that I have a toddler, and he is surely bringing back loads of germs from kindergarten. We've also settled in a foreign country (well, son and wife are from here), so maybe the selection of germs around here are new to my system. But never the less, the pattern between Ritalin and getting sick seems so clear. Lately I've been getting sick every 1-2 months. What do you guys think?

selftext: I'm a young woman who's always been over-thinking a lot about what other people think about me, but this year it's been really though. I overthink every little thing, action, text and conversation. I have a constant feeling that I'm not good enough for my friends and that they think I'm an annoying piece of shit. They often invite me out and says that i'm a nice person to hangout with, my best friend even got emotional when I asked her to be there when I graduate in June. There's literally no signs showing that they don't like me, so It's a frustrating feeling to walk around with..you guys must know that. 

Yesterday I finally had an appointment at my doctors office and she diagnosed me with social anxiety and OCD, I've been having OCD all my life so she just confirmed that it's still there. She made a psychological referral and gave me a webside where I could choose a psychologist in my area. I live in Scandinavia where healthcare is 100% free except dentists and psychologists, but because I'd been to the doctor before contacting a psychologist, I will get some financial support from my county which is great! There's just something I wonder about..My doctor didn't mention anything about medication so now I want to know if it's usually the psychologist who decides which kind of treatment is right? I know it might vary from country to country.

selftext: Hello, this is my first time posting here. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder last fall. I’ve been in a relationship for almost two years - 1.5 of those years have been long distance (600 mi). Things are usually great and I love him, but my anxiety gets in the way sometimes. 

I tend to get really worried when I don’t hear from him in a while and it tends to be worse because I can’t see him in person most of the time, so our communication is mainly through the phone. For example, yesterday I nearly had a panic attack when he was supposed to call me when he got home, but was busy talking to his roommate for an hour and didn’t let me know. In my head, I was thinking the worst - he was kidnapped, the car crashed, he hates me, etc etc. Every time this happens I know in reality that he’s okay, but my mind tends to spiral into bad thoughts. It doesn’t feel very good. 

Also, I tend to over analyze a lot of things said over text, because again, it’s our main form of communication. When he sends short replies or when it just feels off to me for some reason (idk why) I just start to feel very anxious, like something bad is going to happen. 

I’m not sure how to get myself out of the bad place I’m in during those times. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

People have, for years told me how "high functioning" I am. It makes me ill. Just because I can articulate things, doesn't mean it's any less difficult. I'm staying at a temporary sober living house (been clean 6 years from pills.) and you have the folks there who just don't get it. "You don't need a therapist. It's all in your head." other residents have told me.

I have an application pending to the MA. Department of Developmental Services (the Dept. of Mental Health flat out told me to take the DDS route.) and I've been trying to get an advocate, but nobody seems to be willing to work with me. I have asked for their reasoning, and was told "You seem too high functioning."

WTF? Seriously, WTF? Then again, this is Cape Cod and $$ seems to run everything down here.

I have issues that need constant attention, and this homeless shelter/sober living house just isn't cutting it. The prior agency I was with "graduated" me because my caretaker was cooking the books, scoring me higher than it should've been.

I feel like I've been and still am being fucked over. Railroaded, if you will.

My therapist is angry with this whole situation. Especially with the way the prior agency handled me. They flat out became defensive when my therapist talked to them. I cannot handle this any longer.

selftext: **some background** - I'm practicing lots of different kind of mindfulness, dialectical behaviour therapy, and other similar methods. But I keep finding myself snagged for months or years when I feel slighted even once. I'm going through counselling and trying to kind of dismantle all the old issues, but new things happen and I feel ill equipped for it. I've had a psychiatric assessment and been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder/major depressive episodes.

**the issue at present** - I've (30M) been with my girlfriend (28F) for 4 years, there's generally some communication issues here or there but we tend to work it out. There was once though, maybe almost a year ago, where I was up late, before going to bed decided I'd masturbate, end up mentioning it the next morning (a saturday)\*. She gets upset, lots of "why would you masturbate when I'm just asleep in the next room, you could've woken me up". Thing is, sometimes I'm not interested in the whole of sex and she gets frustrated if I don't make her climax so it's no longer my own needs but also being responsible for hers as well. And she is sometimes just severely unpleasant if she doesn't sleep well so why _would_ I wake her. The issue lasted most of the day and was never really revisited. A month or two after I bring up that it's still making me antsy how off the deep-end she went. She apologizes then, "I was wrong, I was way out of line, I'm sorry of course you're _allowed_ to watch porn and/or masturbate". So that was maybe 10 months ago, she never said she was over it in the moment just to "drop it, whatever". I keep getting pangs like I'm doing something sinister or wrong and know I **should** be able to just accept it and move on but I keep getting snagged on something about it. Feeling shamed/dirty for doing something that was heavily normalized in our relationship the last 3 years. It's like a weird betrayal and I just want to forget about it and move on.

So... advice?

**tl;dr:** - Minor stuff causes major hangups in my ability to get over it. Diagnosed persistent depressive disorder/major depressive episodes. Trying to find, ideally a mindful but, really any method on forgiving/accepting/moving on

\*This is pretty common frankly, we have kind of different schedules and sometimes aren't present, so we'll share porn or fantasies in between times where we aren't being intimate.

selftext: I was talking to my mom about mental illnesses that run in our family after she discussed her family history with her uncle. He told her there's a long line of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (i have aunts uncles and a sister who are diagnosed schizophrenic). Then she proceeded to tell me she was never diagnosed bipolar and only sought treatment for severe depression (not for very long) and i mentioned i have researched mental illness and more specifically personality disorders in my last semester at college and she said "oh, that too" and i asked her which one while naming a few "borderline, dependent, anti-social.." and she said with conviction "borderline", but told me she didn't believe the therapist because before the diagnosis they had her husband answer a questionare and she thinks he lied on it so she could qualify for disability in our state and be able to stay at home. If i wasn't already aware that me and her both have bpd I'm sure I'd believe her about him lying in favor of the disability thing but honestly i don't think he lied about her being "moody and unstable" because she always was throughout my childhood with occurences like throwing his clothes out in garbage bags in the street and tipping christmas trees because he was late coming home, it makes more sense than ever. I'm trying not to resent her for not seeking treatment, she's never even been on SSRIs or any other medication for a long period of time, but I'm just imagining what i would be like without being raised by emotinally abusive parents, a bpd mother and an alcoholic step father. I don't hate them or blame them because they are better now in general and if anything it helps to be able to connect the dots of my youth but wow my life would be so much easier if she sought treatment and if he got sober before he physically abused me and my sisters. At least now i know that it's crucial for me and my siblings to seek treatment for this so we don't make the same mistakes. They don't know they have bpd and don't know what it is either and i know I'm not qualified to just say they have it but it's pretty clear as any of you who knew you had bpd before you were professionally diagnosed know too. I'm gonna seek therapy as soon as I'm able to move out. I would start now but my mom doesn't believe treatment works and I'd need her support in order to go while I'm still living with her.. now i just know she was treating the wrong thing and it gives me some peace to know that i need to at least try to be treated..

selftext: I've posted a lot about the problems I've been having with my family and their obsession with me being on the spectrum.

I think what I've been trying to explain is that I personally suspect I *might* be an aspie, and rather than check of the boxes and self-diagnose, I take a good look at things about me that might fit the profile, and I'm trying to pursue testing and a diagnosis, and actually I see being diagnosed as gaining insight into problems I've had over the years and finding better ways to deal with them.  

With my family, they've done their own version of self-diagnosing, but it's very much the whole "check off the boxes" approach, along with shoehorning things about me that they've never understood into aspie stereotypes.   So I'm making sure that the things about me that could be aspie traits are real and not just pointing at interests or odd but harmless habits.  My family is doing just that though.   So it's never been about denial, but rather not wanting to give my family anything they could use to "prove" that I'm some strange mix of really smart and mildly mentally challenged just so they can try to control things because using my physical disability over the years hasn't worked for them. 

The recent "gaslighting" I've had to put up with is them taking things further, creating a situation where I'm backed into a corner and having to put a lot of effort into demonstrating that I'm actually able to live independently without outside accountability or interference.   

I've learned about my own executive functioning problems and have been able on my own to figure out better ways to get things done and not get so overwhelmed by certain things, whereas my parents have created a situation where I'm having to prove how responsible I am by how well I can put out small fires all the time, so to speak, rather than seeing the big picture of how well I've settled into a good routine maintaining my new apartment, and ignoring whatever fake crisis someone comes up with, for example.

What I've been seeing is that much of the "fight" has nothing to do with "responsibility", but rather that they're fed up with seeing me basically being an adult with a physical disability and mild learning disability doing all sorts of adult things that everyone else does without it appearing to "cost" me very much, so to speak.  Beyond having to answer to people I owe money to (rent, regular bills) and being a good tenant in my apartment, no one else is holding me accountable and policing other aspects of my life.   My parents are supportive but they also have a bad habit of trying to make the negative aspects of health issues be the driving force of how I "live".  Since I've "defied" my disability getting in the way, they've dusted off old ideas they've had about me being autistic and have been really after me about "being" an aspie because a few things they don't like happen to fit the profile.   I'm ok with a diagnosis, but I resent the pressure to only accept the stigmatized aspects of it, or the idea that I'll have to accept losing independence if I'm diagnosed.   That's not a medical thing, that's just them trying to project their hangup about me doing my own thing without having to answer to anyone.

So, would it be wrong to play along with them for a while, but simply keep gathering info and pursuing the testing, and if it turns out I really am an aspie, fine with me, but tell my family that the tests were negative when that time comes?  

Granted, a lot of it is moot anyway since I should have a job in the near future and if I'm paying for everything without their help, then that alone takes away a lot of their "right" to meddle, but I want to make for damn sure that they can't find some loophole where they get to insist that someone working and handling their affairs just fine without help is somehow "proof" that I'm still not as responsible as "normal" people.

Previous smoker (5+ years ago, 5/day) Currently diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos hypermobility type, POTs, Adenomyosis/Endometriosis, Bilateral hip dysplasia, inflammatory bowel disease (mast cell mediated). 3 babies in the last 6 years. No surgeries of any kind at this point. 

I have a moveable protruding mass that appears intermittently in my lower right abdomen for approximately 1 year. It does not seem to cause me pain, just morbid curiosity. I do have chronic pelvic pain and groin pain from the other conditions. I made a gif of a video of me shifting it. https://imgur.com/qx28q48 (my first time...it's not great). I can shift it manually though I am not always able to do so. At times it will protrude and if I breathe in and push my stomach out, then let it fall, it will drop back into place shortly after the rest of abdomen has already returned to neutral. (edit: made a gif of this as well) https://imgur.com/jt7dMrc Possibly correlates with times I have excess gas. 

CT was clear, no mass or hernia found. I have a hysterectomy coming up and GYN suspect it may be a hernia but never actually looked at it (it was just in my notes from previous doctor visits). Her plan is to include a general surgeon to repair during hysterectomy. I do have an umbilical hernia. I suspect that it may simply be my cecum. One of the main reasons I'm unsure whether it would be a hernia is it can sometimes be moved and shifted multiple ways, even nearly across my midline (I try not to mess with it, really). I've shown it to a number of health professionals and doctors and the overwhelming reaction is "Huh. That is weird." 

Does a hernia sound right? Spigelian? Floating cecum that protrudes due to weak connective tissue? NBD and I shouldn't think anything of it? My only real concern is that my surgeon is talking tacking on hernia repair that hasn't been diagnosed and I'm not for sure I have. Thanks in advance.

selftext: A little bit of a venting post....

I was diagnosed with ADHD in college by my old psychiatry office which was not Kaiser. I decided to go off of  Adderrall about 6 years because I thought I didn't need it any more after college. Boy was I wrong. I have had such a struggle with jobs and job prospects that I have decided to seek treatment again because my ADHD is really hindering my ability.

Fast forward to 3/2018. I decided to start the process with my LCSW at Kaiser. He mentioned that I may need to go through the Kaiser screening process unless I obtain medical records. Unfortunately, my old psychiatry office was refusing to release my medical records to me (which I found out later they were violating HIPAA). So I decided to start the Kaiser screening process instead.

Fast forward to 5/10 I finally had my screening exam which consisted of 2 hours of answering questions about my ADHD and how it has affected me throughout my life. He said it would take about a week to gather the results and schedule me for a computer exam. I talked to him about how my previous psychiatrist diagnosed me years ago back in 2011/2012 and he said that all I would need to do to expedite the process is gather the records.
After hearing the psychologist say this I went back to my old psychiatry office and cited that they were violating HIPAA but not releasing my records to me. This actually made them comply and they released and sent my records to me. I go back to Kaiser and send these records to the psychologist and of course. He SAYS THEY’RE NOT SUFFICIENT!! What? OK. So I ask him when my next appointment will be and now he said “due to circumstances beyond my control” it will be another 2-4 weeks before the computer exam will even begin.

I don’t know where to go from here. Is there anything I can do to expedite this? This whole process has been exhausting and I don’t know what to do…. Any help or any other people who have gone this through terrible experience please let me know. Thank you.

selftext: 25 years old, male, 6'2", 170lb, caucasian. Been dealing with pityriasis versicolour (or tinea versicolour) for a few of years (I would provide a picture but it has been confirmed by many GPs and it is difficult for me to get a good picture of it.) Currently taking oral ketoconazole (200mg/day)

Hey all,
I was incorrectly diagnosed with pityriasis rosea a few (5ish) years ago and was told there was nothing I could do about it. It then spread from a small patch on my back to all over my back, up to my neck and across my chest with a little bit spreading to my arms and just above my pubic area. About 2 years ago I thought I should get a second opinion and I was diagnosed with pityriasis versicolour by a few different physicians (We are all confident on that diagnosis which is why I haven't included a photo).
I was told to try applying Selsun Blue shampoo over the affected area every day for a month; I did that and it barely helped at all. 
I was then prescribed oral Fluconazole and the patches disappeared quickly and I finished the dose (I don't remember the daily amount or duration that it was taken for). 
A few (probably 5 or 6) months later it started coming back and I hadn't gone back to the clinic until recently. 
This time I was prescribed oral ketoconazole and started taking the 30 day regiment of 200mg/day 2 days ago. Since then I have done a lot of research on the drug and have discovered that it has been banned in the EU, China, and Australia due to possible liver damage; I was not told any of this by the doctor or the pharmacist probably because they think the benefit outweighs the risk. 

This brings me to my main point: I was wondering what your opinions are on taking oral ketoconazole. It seems, from what I've read, that in most cases fluconazole is more effective and less risky but if it doesn't work then it might be worth trying a different oral anti-fungal and I guess that would be the reason I was prescribed ketoconazole this time but I am a little bit worried about the side effects.

Thanks for your time!!

About six months ago while I was driving I felt a vibrating sensation in my head like my brain was rapidly shaking from side to side, I also felt my vision shake as well. Toward the end of the episode I got another sensation in my head that I was falling backward and thought I might actually pass out. It’s happened twice again in the past few weeks, but to a much lesser degree where I just feel like I am falling backwards or have an odd sensation in the back of my head I can’t describe. Almost the way it feels when you take off a tight article of clothing if that makes sense, but with pins and needles. I typically only experience this while seated.

I was diagnosed with GAD ten years ago but these symptoms are new and I don’t think it’s anxiety. This started around the same time I began having GI issues (later diagnosed as chronic gastritis). The symptoms that led me to a gastroenterologist in the first place were near-constant nausea, headaches, fatigue, and lightheadedness which at first did not respond consistently to diet and lifestyle adjustments, though now they seem to. However, some weeks I go with daily headaches regardless. I was given an FBC, CBC, an endoscopy/biopsy, and a full abdominal ultrasound and the only thing out of the ordinary was the mild gastritis and very slightly elevated calcium levels (in the 12.5-13 range IIRC). My GI did not seem concerned by the calcium levels.

I thought it might be vertigo at first because both of my grandparents have it but they don’t experience anything like what I am describing here. Is this worth setting up an appointment with a neurologist or an ENT? TIA.

selftext: My sister is 22 and is in denial she has Aspergers. I think she has it because some of her jokes are inappropriate (like jokes about babies), she doesn't make eye contact and spends her money unwisely. She was in special ed. I recently gave a speech to my public speaking class that my sister is a little autistic and denies it. She told me I should have said "from my prespective" but I told her it is commonly accepted that she's autistic. She said a doctor didn't diagnose her and neither can I. I mean I am not the only person who thinks she's autistic. When I was in HS some of my friends asked me what's wrong with her.

selftext: My son was diagnosed in first grade with ADHD and high IQ. Before, we had to take him to the ER 4 or 5 times He would get into stuff we didn’t know he could get into, falls, etc. If we went for a walk on the beach, we would have to hold his hand because he would run straight into Lake Michigan even when there was ice still floating in it. 

Since treating with Adderall, he hasn’t gotten hurt. He’s turning 12 in a couple months. Meds have done a lot of wonderful things for him, not the least of which is giving him the ability to make safer choices.

selftext: I'm asking a question for my mom. 

Age: 49. ~5'3. ~170-180lbs. Hispanic (Mexican-American). She has been complaining about this for about over a month now.  Right knee if that makes any difference. No diagnosed med issues that I know of other than a slight high blood pressure.  Currently taking Atenol for that (not sure how much, sorry). No rec drugs. Non-smoker. Occasional drinker. 

So my mom has been complaining about knee pain for about a little over a month, maybe almost two. She normally took a quick-paced walk at the park for about an hour. I told her to rest her knee for a month (no going to the park) and it would probably feel better. It remained the same. She did her own research and diagnosed herself as having sciatica. She also claims it will go away. 

Just want to know what sciatica really is? Does it go away? What can be done to treat it/ alleviate the pain? What could be causing this of not sciatic pain? 

PS. I've told her to see a doctor, but she refuses, believing it will go away.

Thank you.

selftext: Age:33  

Sex:F  

Height: 5'9"   

Weight: 300 lbs  

Race: White  

Duration of complaint: 4 years / 2 weeks  

Location on body: Feet and endocrine system  

Any diagnosed medical issues: PCOS, macular degeneration \(yes, really\)

Current medications and doses: Anti\-VEGF injections into eyeball, previously Metformin ER \(1500mg\)  and Zovia \(high dose\)  

any recreational drugs: none  

smoking status: Never tried it, no desire to  

Family history: Everybody has diabetes. Everyone.  

Problem:   

I have PCOS, first diagnosed 4 years ago, but I've been symptomatic for 10 years. I was diagnosed as part of a clinical trial, by high androgens and polycystic ovaries. 

The trial mostly involved taking metformin. After my participation concluded, my PCP agreed to prescribe metformin for me for PCOS, but not for prediabetes \- because even at my weight, my blood sugar and A1C were good \(mostly because of a low sugar diet\). 

After a few months, I noticed that I was experiencing tachycardia after eating. It didn't matter what I ate \- piece of steak, piece of celery, piece of cheese \- heart starts racing. I woke up late one morning and forget my metformin on the way out of the house, and didn't experience any tachycardia that day. I talked to my doctor and stopped metformin. Partially because the tachycardia was very uncomfortable, but also because the metformin wasn't helping me lose weight \(my actual goal\). The tachycardia did not re\-occur.

Still, everybody in my family has diabetes, so I get my A1C tested every physical \(yearly\). I still wasn't pre\-diabetic last year. I quit the Zovia last year, because babies.

For the last two weeks, I have been experiencing shallow skin numbness on both big toes, and the pad of the foot adjacent to them. After trying several different pairs of shoes, I do not think I can blame the numbness on shoes. 

I recently moved, and haven't seen my new PCP yet \(I'm about two months away from my physical\). I called to try and set up an earlier appointment because I am freaking out about diabetes, and I got ... not really a response. They'll call me if an appointment opens up. 

Should I be freaking out yet? I don't think an urgent care place would test my A1C, diagnose diabetes, and send me on my way with a metformin Rx, but I am concerned that waiting two months to start treating it isn't a healthy choice either. Please advise.

I've had my chest rash for a long time, maybe 15 years, although it's usually only 1-2 red dots on my chest. Now it's much more and I got no clue why, I'm not using any skin products. The rash feels like a small bump in the skin and it stays there for perhaps 1-2 weeks until it has disappeared. The rash is constant, I regularly get new red spots usually on my upper chest. Sometime it itches. 

What could this be?

selftext: So my parents and especially my dad care about me getting high grades. He was a strait A student and he expects me to do the same. But the problem is: I cant focus on school work, I forget what work I have or I lack the motivation to ever do it. When I do pay attention i understand all of it so I don't thinks that I just cant handle what classes I'm taking, I'm just not focused. 

I love them to death but it deeply saddens me to hear them say every time i bring it up that they "don't want my personality changing" or "want me addicted" or "want me taking medication that I don't need". In addition, they've stated that they "would find a punishment so horrible for you that you would make sure you'd do your homework." which is terrifying for me. But who knows, It could just be me being a teenage boy?

So the question is: how can I convince them to get me diagnosed or get me on medication to help me, OR, get help without them?

TL;DR: Parents wont help me get diagnosed or get medication/ how can I get help around them?

selftext: Hi, my boyfriend for about over a month has had pretty bad testicle pain. At first it was in the left one and has slowly traveled to the right. The pain is mostly in his left. He’s also had abdominal and back pains with this month. Headaches are on board too but he is diagnosed with chronic headaches so it’s hard to tell if it’s cancer that would be causing it. Another possibid symptom is nose bleeds. Last week he had one for 15 minutes on Tuesday but lost a bit of blood. He got another one the Thursday after and it was 40 minutes long with multiple blood clots. His come also tastes very acidic to me like vomit does.

We went to the doctors yesterday for it, the lady asked him questions, and then she felt for any lumps or anything unusual. After she left and came back she scheduled a blood test, ultrasound, and a follow up appointment. When she listed her concerns she first said testicular cancer, then a hernia or testicular torsion. With testicular torsion she said he would’ve already been to the hospital for immense pain. He doesn’t have any stds either.  

My concern is when doctors think it’s cancer do you usually check for it first and get everything out of the way? She made sure to get all of the appointments done this week and a follow up next Monday. This concerns me she made it so sudden. Should we be worried? Do you guys think it’s cancer?

selftext: Hi everyone!!

I am an actress in college and I have ADHD-PI, which I currently take 15mg Adderall XR (morning) and 7.5mg IR (late afternoon) for. Because I was diagnosed this summer, this spring was the first time I had ever had a rehearsal and performance process with medication.

I experimented with taking my evening dose of medication during rehearsal and performance. In general I found that taking it made me able to focus on the technical aspects, like remembering blocking and lines, while not taking it let me think about the creative aspects and lead to new and interesting ideas. For performances, I drank a cup of coffee and took half my dosage of medication. While this meant I was able to get all the technical aspects of the performance down, I felt like it inhibited my ability to feel and express the emotion of the character somewhat. I also had a bit more difficulty switching between the two characters I was playing than I remember having when I was unmedicated and playing two characters in high school. It might be important to mention that A) this was Shakespeare and B) both characters are strong, tempestuous women who are very powerful and somewhat hard to approach as a 20 year old.

Obviously I want to be as emotionally open as possible in performance, but I also want to be able to focus on the technical aspects as well. Any advice or similar situations?

I'm super into music. Not just listening to it, but also making it. I'd link my Soundcloud but I don't wanna come off like I'm just marketing myself ahah. I mainly make Synthwave but recently tried making more Vaportrap which was fun. I also like making Chiptunes every so often. Unfortunately the computer I was using for production decided to die so until I get a job, I'm stuck with all of these ideas in my brain.

I also enjoy watching Wrestling, movies and tv shows. I fond that I dont care about genres when it comes to tv and movies. I like most flicks. I like most shows (except big bazooka theorem ;) ).

I absolutely love exploring the city and different suburbs (if they have anything to do). Im currently making a list of free stuff to do around the city.

I have a wonderful girlfriend of two years who has becone the only non family member that I really talk to anymore and I also have been diagnosed with Severe Depression and Anxiety disorder which might explain how I don't really have any friends.

selftext: I was diagnosed with cancer last year and have been on Temozolomide chemotherapy for nearly a year now.

17% of patients have an immediate bad reaction to the temozolomide. Luckily I'm not one of them.
Generally it doesn't have much of a negative effect until a few days after a cycle where I begin to get indigestion.

Thing is I did have one bad night. Ive had mild nausea from treatment before but then I don't know what was going on but I had very bad stomach pains and nausea. Eventually it went away and I got to sleep after distracting myself with television.

But since then when I'm in the middle of a chemo cycle I'll just start wondering if this is the time it'll start. If I'm finally going to become the classic cancer patient, gaunt face, pallid skin, and chained to a bucket. I have anti emetics but they're expensive and have side effects. I only take them with my chemo pills to be safe.

I wish I'd found this sub years ago. This anxiety is one of the hardest struggles in my life. I've stayed up nights eyes wide because of a gurgle. Cried my eyes out in frustration when I do get sick. And now I work with kids, and nothing will keep me from that, even a brain tumor. But I can't help but feel guilty when I hold back comforting a sick child because im scared.

I'm sorry for how long this is. But it's 25 years of pent up frustration that I've finally found people to talk to about it.

selftext: I am not diagnosed with Asperger's (yet, but I am going to a psych soon to find out), but after years of crazy hard work to just try to communicate effectively without being misunderstood I have some suspicions.

1. Do you tend to explain yourself in a very detailed and specific way to make sure you get understood in that very specific way?

2. Do you get misunderstood often, especially on the "social soft skills" side of things? (Eg, maybe coming across as being arrogant or insensitive by just really saying what you think things really are)

3. Do you have the obsession to use the exact correct terms to refer to the correct things?

4. Do you feel the urge to flinch and correct someone when they use the wrong terms?

5. Are you very/extremely disheartened when things do not go your way?

6. Do you feel like you are constantly holding in reins, albeit perhaps unable to be yourself in fear of rejection if you just try to be just you? (But you all are awesome being just you btw ❤️)

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I am trying to find if anyone can relate to these feelings. Any responses will help me loads in trying to know myself better. I am not sure if these are Asperger's syndromes neither do I represent to define, I just want to see how many can relate to these issues I  have. Your feedback is important to me and I am grateful. Thank you!

selftext: Hello! 

2 years ago I was diagnosed with BPD. 
My life after diagnosis is much better because i can understand myself. I didn’t had a panic attack since than. My self confidence went up, especially after laser eye surgery went sky high. My suicide thoughts went away from thinking about it every day to when I have crisis. But I still have one big problem with feelings. Whenever I meet a girl i like issues come. I understand that i was abandoned by my parents which is the cause for BPD. I know I need some time and distractions to overcome this. But this time I just can’t. After 7 years of avoiding dating i went to one. She invited me for dinner because we both travel a lot and she wanted to talk with me personally about it. Everything went well for me. Until third time we meet. We got a little to much drunk after party so we slept together and i got feelings for her. I’m stressed out and my feelings are dark and anxiety is killing me. I know that the most of my life I’m alone. I tried to cheer up myself but I just can’t. I am afraid to be left alone and broken again. I know that I miss the “love” because of parents. I’m 26 years old and last time i had girlfriend was 8 years ago. Every thing i build for my self after diagnosis just disappeared. Currently I am not able to leave the apartment. I just want to sleep.

selftext: Hi there. Im new to reddit so hope im doing this right. Im looking for help with how to communicate better with my friend. Im always upsetting her amd i try to apologize and validate her feelings. But i just always sense  she ready to defend, at anything and everything. Its starting to really grate on me, the defensiveness is shown by digging in her heels and even when i know she knows she has hurt me she wont apologize... I had issues in the beginning of my relationship when i found out my partner still had contact with his ex, they co parent a dog, but i empathized with my partner and was unwilling to either- force him to not see Fido - or break it off with him. 
Fast forward a year and me and her are really close, she comes over all the time and shes extremely generous with time and advice. But lately ive been feeling angry, dominated &amp; bullied  in my own home. Then extremly guilty for trying to stand my ground, then  angry again from my own juvenile expection that she would also apologize. My partners best friend mentioned she had been diagnosed with bpd about 8 yrs ago. So ive been trying to find out as much as i can about how i can better my communication skills to convey these issues without her giving me " the look" , icily fleeing the situation, and directly and pointedly refraining from any attempts to resolve issues. Any advice would be seriously appreciated. Thank you!!!

selftext: You know..

When I first wanted to die I sat in my room crying into my pillow literally praying to be killed in my sleep by a freak accident of some kind I was maybe 9 or 10, but now that I'm 20 almost 21 I think I've finally worked up the courage to do it. I couldn't think of a better place to leave my final message so I decided to go from lurker to poster today.

For all of you who will see this, I want to thank You, I want you to know that just because I chose to kill myself didn't mean I was necessarily living a shitty life either. I actually love my jobs and my son, my girlfriend is nice and overall life is good. I just can't bring myself to keep slogging through it all anymore.

I've been dealing with depression since I was 8, and was diagnosed with psychosis earlier this year. It's not even how I ever figured it would all be. Sometimes I hear voices that tell me to end it. I think it's time I listen. I wish you all the absolute best on this board. A lot of brave souls ending it soon. I was gonna hold out until may 23rd which is my birthday but what's another birthday when you're gonna end it anyways right? To all of those who have the same idea as me, I wish you luck in your methods. Let it be painless and fast for us all.

selftext: I could just really use some time to write this out and express myself and feel like someone's reading.

I was diagnosed with GAD years ago but I've been in remission and haven't had any sort of treatment in a while (I've been pretty much fine).

A few things in my life that I can't control are making me highly anxious. One is waiting on results of my graduate school application - I feel like I'm not going to get in and there's nothing more I can do at this point. Another is my fear that I'll never own a home and never be financially secure - even though my salary isn't bad, and I'm already following a very strict savings plan.

The fact that I can't control these things is causing my anxiety to go off the charts. I'm afraid of feeling like a failure (I've always been a perfectionist and the idea that I might not get in to grad school is one of the worst things I've ever felt).

I've cut out coffee in the past few weeks and that hasn't helped at all. I've upped my exercise from 2 times per week to 4 times per week and that hasn't helped. My anxiety isn't ruining my life so I feel like I shouldn't need to resort to medication or professional help (can't afford that on my own and the wait time for government mental health care is months to years - I don't think it would be best for me).

My anxiety seems to stem from the fact that I'm a perfectionist and just terrified of failure. How do I fix this?

selftext: I have had depression since I was 13, it team3d up with anxiety when I was about 17. Then last year I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome  (21). This has been slowly sapping all energy from my life and there isn't a cure. It has caused me to drop out of university and fuel the fire that is that all powerful tag team of depression and anxiety. My life is going nowhere, I have no employable skills and no motivation to change that. And lately it's all been too much. I know that smoking weed really helps calm me down and just get through and episode, or maybe immersing myself in a computer game (I'm no gamer and don't have a good laptop for gaming but it can do the job). Yet I lie in bed and stare and the wall. I could do yoga to clear my head or well anything. But I never do. I can when I'm halfway down the spiral, But if I go too far I don't want the help. Maybe is masochism, maybe this is just what depression can do. Because in this state I don't even want to kill myself I just want to sleep and make it stop. Then I go a bit up and then suicidal thoughts creep in saying "please never let me go there again " but I don't because I can't cause the amount of pain that would ripple out. And the cycle continues. 

TL;DR when it gets bad all i do is lie in bed staring at the things that could help and ignoring them. Too latharic to be suicidal.

selftext: Hi guys, my name is Dom. My life's been shit. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and my girlfriend knew. She just decided to break up with me, and block me in everything because she was too tired. I understand why though. But I was trying to get better for her, I was going to the gym regularly as I did before I had depression. Making new friends. And now she's gone even before I got the chance. I knew she'd get tired, I knew it. But she insisted that she never will, but she did. I tried my best in this life, but I have always failed. Have always been a failure. I told her that I wanted to commit suicide, but she didn't care. She told me she doesn't care. So that kind of pushed me to commit suicide. 2 weeks ago,  I had an attempt. Last night, I had another attempt. Tonight, I will attempt again. And I will try with all my might to die. My dad might beat me if I survive though, so I'm afraid of that. I hope my grandma doesn't see me dangling from the support beam. So, before I go, I plan to make a video to give closure. And after that, I'm going to call a friend who's a fair distance away from me to come, so that she can claim my body without my grandmother ever seeing it. Anyways, I don't know why I'm posting this here. I just needed somewhere to say this before I do it. Felt like the final piece of the puzzle.

selftext: Can gabapentin work opposite way and increase pain?
Maybe I am diagnosing this wrong.
I have a wound in my foot and it's been about 30 days..... It had healed and the scab is beginning to lift. When I flex my toes I notice the scab begin to lift even more....

I started on gabapentin last night I took a 300mg dose. This morning I took one and one in the evening. So all together from last night until now it's been 3 capsules....

I was given gabapentin because I told my doctor I was feeling zaps of electricity when I attempt to walk on my foot due to a slam injury I had. I ran into a ladder and caused the wound. He says I have injured the plantar common digital nerve. That's why I am getting these zaps.

Today however the wound with the scab lifting naturally I am feeling pain and burning sensation from the wound but primarily  the ball area which feels like it's inflamed and sensitive to touch..for a couple of hours today it felt like a brick.... I feel my nerves in my foot as though it's an open water faucet. It's hard to explain but my foot feels like it's throbbing. 

Is this the wound or the nerve healing? 
Is this because of the gabapentin?
 Is this because the scab is lifting? 
I am completely lost. 

Since these 30 days I have not had the wound feel like it's feeling today. I was literally able to put my hand on it and it had no pain or effect.

selftext: For some background, I’m a high school student. I know both ADHD and depression are common among my age group, but it doesn’t make either of them suck any less. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was eleven years old and in the five years since then I’ve used Focalin and Adderall. I stopped using Focalin and switched to Adderall around a year and a half ago when I became very apathetic in my come-downs and basically didn’t do any schoolwork.

I started having depressive side affects in December, but kept taking my Adderall anyway for the sake of my grades. After a while, I decided I didn’t want to deal with it any more and stopped taking the medication. I was off of it for about a month. In that time, I felt mildly better but my grades took a huge hit. My GPA was around 2.7. My parents were naturally really upset about this, and I had to go back on the medication.

As of now, I’m on Adderall, my grades are better (still bad, but better), and I still feel like shit all the time. Switching medication is not a option because of something to do with insurance that I honestly don’t know anything about. My parents said that I could see a therapist, but each time I ask they say that they’ll see. My school does not have a psychologist, which really surprised me.

Anyway, I feel like I have to make the decision between my grades and my happiness and I’m not really sure what to do.

selftext: I've had tics for four years, I am now 18 and it's gotten more persistent now. I've experienced many types of motor and vocal tics but I'm good at hiding it or saving it for later but it has become somewhat harder to do it and it's happening more automatically now. Especially now it's my hands and my face.

They started at 14. It was bad between 14-15. Teachers didn't do or notice anything. I was on IEP so they probably brushed it off as odd behaviors related to a different disorder I was diagnosed with awhile back.

16-17 not as much, still many days of the month.. 
Between 17½ to 18 ½ I barely had anything, like it would be very mild. Like 5-10 days of the month I would have in a day about 20 minutes to an hour or two of tics and then it would go away for weeks..

Now it's literally almost everyday, I do work but it almost completely disappears because it's my career and passion.

But before work and/or after work. It comes back. Doesn't matter if I didn't sleep, slept enough. Didn't eat or ate a lot.etc


I don't know how to really go about seeing someone. I've never made an appointment by myself before. I just want answers. I'm a little afraid they might not 'happen' at the appointment or the doctor won't believe me and think I'm nuts.

edit: i know i can't ask for diagnosis here but I just want advice on how to approach my issue to a doctor

The friends husband took over all her properties and wants to sell them.   He's keeping it at the same price of $125,000 which was the original agreement but not taking into account what we've already paid since we moved in.  I've tried getting a loan but cannot get approved.   So my home will go up for sale at $160,000 June 1st.  :(  My significant other who truly is the love of my life tells me 2 weeks ago he's leaving me.   I can't find a place to rent due to a broken lease on my credit report from when I moved into the house in 2013.  I have 2 weeks to be out of my home and no place to go.   :(   I am so sad by everything that keeps happening I'm ready to just give up.

selftext: 1. Does anyone else's anxiety sky rocket when spring hits? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over a year ago now and it was last year that I started noticing a trend...every spring I am 10x more anxious than normal. I can't relax and I need twice my normal dosage on my medicine at least 3 times a week. I've talked to my doctor about this and he recommended that I start seeing a therapist but with my current work schedule its difficult to actually make it to a therapist once a week. Does anyone else experience this? What do you do to help? 2. With my anxiety spiking around this time of year every year and me being in a new relationship (just had our 3 month anniversary yesterday) I'm worried constantly that any minute every minute I'm going to get a text from my girlfriend breaking up with me. I'm asking every hour or two if she's ok or if she's mad or something like that and I feel like I'm causing distance between us two because that's all we've been able to talk about for the past few days. Idk what I can do to help myself be more at ease and subsequently be a better boyfriend to her and be more in the relationship instead of in my head so much. I'm worried that shes going to leave any day now and I really care about her a lot and I want to be there for her and actually have fun with her and everything I just don't know what I can do to right now to be a better person :/ any advice is very much appreciated

selftext: I’m not sure if I am depressed. I feel so stressed and unhappy all the time and I don’t feel hopeful for the future. I’m not sure if I have a mental health problem or if everything I am sad about is rational. These things have happened to me:

• I mucked up several of my High school exams despite trying really hard all year
•I moved to university and have really struggled to make any proper friends
•I put on a lot of weight and eventually ended up with an overweight BMI
•I was diagnosed with high blood pressure which really freaked me out and I had to come of the contraceptive pill
•I had a pregnancy scare which made me completely anxious for a whole month before I could take a test
•I am struggling to keep up with all the work I get from university. Even with my best efforts I will probably not do well on my exams this year.
•I had a sudden break out of severe acne
•I lost a lot of weight (on purpose), but now my hair is dramatically falling out 
•I was very anxious for a month about a jaw operation I was meant to be having. It was cancelled at the last minute which really got me down.

I could probably go on but I don’t want to bore everyone. I’m just not sure if I am depressed or if I am just upset all the time in a rational way because of shitty things that keep happening to me. Anyone got any advice?

selftext: Hey all,

I've been lurking on here for a while because I recognise several of the symptoms of ADD in myself and although I haven't been diagnosed and am aware they may be down to something else, it helps to read others experiences to educate myself more about it. 

What I'm worried about is I'm starting my masters thesis next week \- this is going to be an intense 3 months of using various software and online journals to analyse a dataset on a worktop and produce a 10,000 word report. I experience problems with both getting started working and keeping focus, and getting distracted \- in  doing similar work before I have looked at the clock and noticed I've been sitting there for over an hour zooming in and out following various jumbled lines of thought in my head. I'm a chronic procrastinator and switching between tasks kills my productivity which is especially going to be a challenge as I'll have to work using multiple windows and tab groups.  I've read through our report guidelines and there's so much emphasis \(bold text\) in there about us having to take ownership of our projects and that this is a hugely important piece of work, and I just feel this pit of dread every time I think about it.

I'm in the UK and from what I've read there's no way I could get a diagnosis within the timeframe I'll be working on this project.  I've heard about classmates using 'study drugs' for the insane focus but I'm not so keen on the illegality especially if they might not help. Does anyone have any other guidance or tips on how I can get through this?

Thanks!

selftext: I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple years ago after a particularly bad depressive episode. My psychiatrist prescribed me a low dose of lithium which helped stabilize me and with some life changes (moving closer to my family, new job), my depression got a lot better. My new psychiatrist kept me on lithium (300mg) and gave me Wellbutrin (150mg) for depression, but it never felt like the Wellbutrin did much. A couple months ago he told me that I could stop taking both of them because my mood had been stable for over a year.
About a month ago, I started feeling depressed again and told my psychiatrist that maybe I needed to start on meds again, but that I’d like to try something different than Wellbutrin. He put me back on the lithium and prescribed effexor(37.5mg). It totally knocked me out, made me tired and unfocused all the time so I was missing work, and made me feel me feel totally hopeless. I tried to stick it out but I feel like the Effexor made me feel me more depressed than before. I’m meeting my psychiatrist tomorrow to discuss and was hoping I could suggest some other meds to try. 

So my question is are there any meds that would be good for giving me more energy and focus? I’m still unsure if traditional antidepressants will work for mood disorders, but if there’s something that will get me out of bed, I’m all for it. I’d love to hear what has worked for all of you.

Thanks!

selftext: I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD last week. I feel like utter shit. I'm so angry.

The weekend before my diagnosis, I got into a screaming match with my cousin after our aunt's funeral that ended in her telling me "your boss is right, you need counselling" and me just yelling "fuck you" over and over again and flipping her off repeatedly.

Tonight while out with some friends at a bar, I told one of them to shut the fuck up because I felt like he was disrespecting my fiancee. This friend is trans (FtM) and has been getting on my nerves lately because he's trying out some new machismo act. I even admitted that telling him to stfu was an overreaction, but just asked him not to speak that way. Another one felt the need to add in extra comments, which I told her were unnecessary and not helping. Then the other says "you're literally acting crazy". Again, it just ends in me calling them cunts, asking what they're gonna do about it, and flipping them off with a "fuck you" for each of them.

I know I'm overreacting, I know I'm pushing my support system away....but I don't know how to stop and the things that are said in anger make me not want to reconcile. I don't know if I'm subconsciously doing this because it would be easier to off myself or what. I know these diagnosises aren't an excuse for this behavior and it will probably be better when I get therapy and medication but everyone will probably hate me before that happens.

selftext: Hello and thank you to anyone who can provide advice as I am studying accounting and know nothing about the medical field.

I am currently 20 years old, male, 175 lbs, 6 foot 3 inches tall, no prior medical problems, I do not smoke, and very occasionally drink

I had an echocardiogram done a few days ago and I was diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve. I didn’t notice any symptoms but my doctor suspected I had this condition for a while.

-all of the other valves, ventricles, ventricular dimensions, and atrials came back normal.

-the problem was the bicuspid aortic valve and the mildly dilated aortic root

-systolic flow showed normal velocity and moderAte regurgitation, eccentric

-normal antegrade flow pattern and trivial regurgitation

-mild tricuspid regurgitation 

- no significant pulmonic insufficiency

Suggested echocardiogram in 1 year.

I lift weights four times a week. I also do cardio a lot during the week maybe 3-4 times. I don’t know if I can stop because these are essential parts of my life and make me who I am. Is this going to speed up the surgery requirement? I understand that this will one day require surgery and I am not sure if I can do it. Is there a chance I can live normally without needing surgery?

I consider myself pretty healthy. I try to eat a balanced diet and keep active as much as possible even if I am busy.

I’m sorry if I didn’t post enough information. I can add more if necessary. Thanks again for any advice you all can provide.

selftext: My last post got into me finding out I was diagnosed at a young age but not treated due to cost. After finally being told at age 25. I was planning on not seeking treatment but I found a  local psych that was willing to help and was a reasonable cost.

Providing cost info in the event someone on reddit wants a reference for non-insured medical care in the US. I will update with med cost if I am advised I need them. I think I do but I am not a psychiatrist.

* $400 for my first session for diagnosis.
* $175 for a checkup two weeks later
* $175 for a  checkup one month later
* $175 after the previous two per quarter for a quarterly update.
* $200-500 per 30 day rx is the average but I have nothing confirmed.

I am really excited to see a professional and get some advice and potential medication! I honestly cannot even remember the last time I was this excited about anything. Way more affordable than I thought. None of this is covered by insurance and rather than pay $300 a month for insurance that is strictly for the worst case scenario locked behind a $2700 deductible. Using that $300 a month towards medication/treatment is something I would much prefer. I will be utilizing an HSA @$480 per month towards lessening the cost over all!

Thanks everyone for all the advice! I will update on how it goes. It will be in two weeks.

selftext: I spent three years in an apartment only going outside for food and other necessities. I played video games all day and watched youtube videos and made art. Minimal social interaction. I've been diagnosed with anxiety since I was 13. 

This past December, I got an email from a creative director at a NYC advertising agency out of the blue and he offered me an internship based on some of the art I posted online.

I flew out there and finished the internship. I was scared shitless on the plane and leading up to the whole thing. 

But I did it. I fucking did it. I was in the busiest, loudest, most faced pased city in America. I had to ride the subway packed full of hundreds of people. I had to interact with producers and directors. I had deadlines.

Somehow, somewhere the courage to accomplish this task was deep inside of me. And I just want to say if I can do it, you can do it. It's possible. Things do change. You are not forever trapped in your anxiety. 

My challenge for you today is to get out of your comfort zone. 

Try something new. Try something different. Even if it's the smallest thing you can think of. Try it. You will be suprised what the human brain is capable of.

I hope I inspired at least one of you today. If it did, posting my story has been a success. Good luck to you. You can do it.

edit: Thank you for all the kind words. Was not expecting this response. It makes me want to continue doing what I'm doing. :) Thank you!

selftext: Hey everybody!  
I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 12 \(I'm 29 now\).

I started playing the drums when I was 18 and we've been going a long way together. I would consider myself playing on a semi\-professional level now. It even led to me touring with my band in foreign countries.

Ever since I started playing my friends said that I have become calmer and more focused. I also noticed after I played drums I am more relaxed and attentive. Considering the huge amount of posts here on dopamine and how sports help with releasing it, I see a parallel to playing the drums.

Most of the time I play Prog/Metal/Death Metal/Jazz/... basically everything with fast and/or complicated rhythms and structures, so I can consider playing drums as kind of a work out \(my heart beats faster, my muscles hurt, I sweat a lot...so basically...work out\). But it is so much more. When playing I have almost no problem on concentrating, I even became specialized in polymetrics \(playing multiple metrics at once\) and they demand a lot of attention. Basically I think it helps me a lot in learning/training how get myself together.

I have tried out numerous sports \(Karate, Scuba\-Diving, Walking, etc.\), but they all get boring after a while, maybe because they don't require the same the same level of attention or simply don't feel as rewarding.

Have you guys experienced the same, maybe even with other music instruments?

selftext: I'm a 38/m who has a history of mental illness and I feel like I'm at another breaking point. I was diagnosed with schizo-affect disorder as a teen and spent over a month as an inpatient and years as an out patient programs. I was prescribed an assortment of  antipsychotic, antidepressants, anti anxiety medication but felt better only after weaning my self off of them. I went from having no purpose or hope to finding gainful employment, a wife, a house and a beautiful daughter. 

I've progressively been feeling worse and worse over the past 5 years or so, to the point now where I avoid most social situations outside of work and it's everything I can do to make it through the day. I have felt my attitude/temper/energy and thought processing change dramatically over the past few months and I worry I'm nearing or am already at a state of full blown phycosis. 

I enjoy my work but there's a tension between my employer and I and I feel he's been slandering my name to our clients as an way to prevent me from leaving him to start my own business. (I know how crazy this sounds) but I've witnessed him do it with other people. 

I am actively seeking other employment but I fear I don't have the energy/fortitude or wearwithall to succeed. 

Does anyone know of any sort of relief program for people in situations like mine? I have mortgage insurance although I don't know if I'm covered for medical leave. I live in Ontario Canada.

selftext: So I decided to post here after a while by realizing that there is no real help for people in my situation.  I am 44 this year, I found out at the age of 37 I had Aspergers/Autism since they have now been lumped into one diagnosis.

I was born with a brain injury \(thanks to a Dr.\) and was diagnosed with Dyslexia and an unknown LD. It turned out that unknown LD was Autism/Aspergers.

I had a job until recently, I was also had a chance to get a condo, now it's all been taken from me because I lost my job and without a job I can't get the condo.  The problem is that the place I was renting from has already told us we need to be out by the 4th of next month.

So, here I am working a contract job, a week and change away from being evicted, and attempting to get a place in that time is going to be interesting.

How do people with High\-Functioning Autism/Aspergers survive in this day and age while being an adult?  It seems all the entities that they are all geared towards children, and tell everyone else after they hit the age of adulthood to go pound sand.I would love to know what kind of real support systems out there, because groups like Autism Speaks seem to be only for children and when I ask for help, or direction from there, they give canned responses which seem to say "sorry, but you are on your own."

selftext: Hi everyone,

I have just started using Lyrica \(pregabalin\) as an add on to my Zoloft for social anxiety/depression. As you may know, I have Aspergers as well and was diagnosed from an early age. To my surprise I experienced a significant reduction in anxiety, found that socialising was so much easier and I became very talkative. Other experiences online have also reported the prosocial and anxiolytic effects as well. Now coming back to the topic of Aspergers, I did a bit of research and found out that some of the causes of autism spectrum social deficits is a due to problems with the gaba neurotransmitters and calcium channels mutations. Pregabalins mechanism of action is to block calcium channels which results in a lowering of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate which indirectly increase gaba particularly the gaba\-b receptors. This could be a scientific explanation of why many people and myself experienced a prosocial effect. This drug or similar drugs should be researched for Aspergers as I believe there could be a lot of potential for it to be a treatment option.

here are the links to the studies:

selftext: Hi all, sorry in advance if this post sounds depressing. I just need to vent and hopefully get advice on here. 

I am 26/F. My grandmother died of ALS 5 years ago. No one else in my family had it as far as i know, but i come from an abnormally large family. My parents are first cousins \(it was a cultural norm back in the day\) and both my grandmas are sisters. My other grandmother died of kidney failure. They both lived until their 80's. 

I have been obsessing over the thought of having ALS for the past week. But every year like clock work i worry for a month straight about it. Last year i was diagnosed with carpal tunnel in my left hand. I got a brace and thought my fears were behind me. my doctor did a strength test and told me i showed no weakness to indicate that I have ALS. 

Recently, I have been feeling a numb spot just under my toes on the flat of my left foot. And i am freaking the FUCK out. I am doing weird things throughout the day to test my strength. And the anxiety is just mind torture at this point. I do sit down for the majority of my job and cross my legs. If that indicates anything at all. Some kind words are needed at this point and i wish i could cheer up. Thanks in advance and sorry for this long post.

Something weird happens to me. Majority of time when im talking some words refuse to leave my mouth. Sometimes i cant say a word and sometimes i cant say a sentence. Sometimes i cant say my name at all this made me unable to live a normal life. It happens randomly. I don’t specifically have to be anxious even tho i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. This problem still presents when im happy or excited or sad or neutral. It does happen MORE often in emotional extremes but its there all the time its like i get temporarily mute for no reason and randomly and with no specific people. Total randomly. The thing is also out of my hand unlike shyness or normal anxiety. Its not that i’d rather not talk its more like im seriously mute at this moment i CANT TALK. My therapist couldn’t understand the problem and im starting to think im the only one like this.... note: i also went to speech therapist but the problem didn’t appear in my sessions with them and they insisted nothing is wrong with me and said its weird how sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn’t and how its random. And told me they don’t know whats wrong with me. Also went to a neurologist today and he done normal checks and said nothing is wrong and i’ll make a brain scan but the doctor predicted that there will be nothing wrong with it.

selftext: My \(ex\)boyfriend of 2 years recently left me because both of us had severe depression and neither one of us could really help each other. I went back to therapy to treat my depression and in the meanwhile, I was diagnosed with BPD recently \(a week ago, my therapist has been seeing me since I was just a teen 3\-4 years ago\). It made me relieved that I finally could list a few symptoms I had \(instable emotions, tendency for self\-harm, trust issues, spontaneous switching of views, etc.\) but it also made me feel really shitty. I told my therapist that it made me feel like shit that I had yet another mental disorder \(also have long\-term depression and anxiety\), but my therapist told me not to see it like that, and instead to just see it as "something that can be treated". 

It still makes me feel like shit though. It makes me feel like I'm some sort of a monster for not being able to control myself properly, and it makes me feel so useless. It makes me feel guilty for being alive, as if my purpose on this planet is just to live in pain. And overall, it makes me feel like shit because I'm not even able to provide a stable relationship for my ex, who deserved much better. I'm not able to provide stable relationships for anyone, and it hurts me so much.

selftext: Hi all. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid and diagnosed again with ADHD Primarily Inattentive Type recently. It's made my life and everyday living really difficult. I'm always losing things from room to room, leaving important things on the bus, forgetting to turn the oven off, forgetting to lock the doors, and forgetting to let the dogs inside \(even when I set a timer, I'll go upstairs and forget I set it.\) Trying to start anything productive feels like an insurmountable task. I always have to go back when I'm reading several times or when I'm watching tv; it takes me an hour to watch a half\-hour show. It's interfered in both my romantic relationships and my education. In college I always had trouble doing things by the deadline. I kept staying up all night trying to complete assignments the night before they were due and it would give me horrible panic attacks that sent me to the ER. Eventually I had to medically withdraw from college, and I haven't been back in 5 years.  


Over the past 2 years I've prioritized trying to find a medication that works for me, and I'm so frustrating that nothings works for me after several doses of several different medications. Adderall seemed to do nothing for me at 5 or 10 mg, and at 15 mg it just gave me a calm and sleepy sensation. Ritalin made me experience depersonalization and derealization at the smallest dose, made it hard to initiate conversations with people, and made my concentration problems even worse; it was like I was constantly walking through taffy. Vyvanse did nothing for me at lower doses, but at a higher dose it had the same effects as Ritalin. Wellbutrin and Guanfacine both did nothing at all, but had no side effects either. I haven't taken Dexedrine in a long time, but it took away my appetite back when I was in junior high school to the point where I was dangerously thin, and didn't help my concentration. I haven't taken Straterra since high school, it didn't do anything back then, and I won't take it again because it only comes in gelatin capsules in my country and I'm a vegetarian. I don't remember Clonodine helping at all, but I haven't taken it since 3rd grade. I've never felt like any medication has "lifted the fog" or even made anything less foggy, and whenever I hear other people's experiences that their medication has done that I feel like a starving puppy watching people eat through a restaurant window.  


I've tried everything else I can think of to try to manage my symptoms. I eat a healthy and balanced diet of whole foods without excessive sugar and make sure to get enough Omega\-3s and Vitamin D \(I've started taking a Vitamin D supplement too, and my levels are normal.\) I've never learned to drive \(because I'm afraid of being distracted while driving\) so I walk everywhere almost an hour every day and get a lot of exercise. 6 months ago I started strength training 3 days  too, but it hasn't improved my symptoms. I sleep 8 to 9 hours a night and I've tried shifting to waking up consistently at a time that maximizes my productivity. I meditate daily, which has helped my anxiety but not my ADHD. My most effective strategies have been keeping a daily planner, prioritizing time management, cleaning the space around me, cutting the amount of tv I watch, keeping a checklist of daily habits I want to do, and trying to put everything in the same place, but even then I feel like I'm only a tenth as productive as everyone else and spend an hour every day trying to find things. I've also tried caffeine and edible marijuana just to see what would happen, but both make me even less focused and trigger panic attacks. I haven't used either at all in 3 years.  


Since I'm unresponsive to medication, I've tested other medical issues to see if they could be the problem with both this and my excessive fatigue. My thyroid is completely normal. My hemoglobin is always high, but my ferritin is always low, so I'm seeing a specialist soon for anemia. I was diagnosed with Asperger's in junior high, but I don't know how that would change how I respond to medication.  


I've been through 2 med providers in the past 2 years \(who both left the practice\) and just saw my third a week ago. She seemed stumped and just wanted to try me on an anti\-depressant \(Trintellix.\) She thinks depression might be causing some of the symptoms considering I have a history of depressive episodes, but the only symptoms of depression I actually have right now are excessive fatigue and not being able to concentrate. It seems like she's throwing her hands in the air and has no idea what to do to help me. I'm at a loss of what to do. Should I try the anti\-depressant for a few months and see what happens? Should I get a new med provider? Should I just drop out of medication therapy and give up the hope that anything will ever make this better for me?

selftext: I was in a mental hospital last year for 5 days, was diagnosed with 3 disorders and put on 2 medications. The meds really helped, but after some money issues with my family I had to stop taking them.

It’s been almost a year. I’m at my worst, and suicidal thoughts are my main concern. I want help. 

I really need to go on meds again, but I’m terrified of being admitted into a mental hospital again. How much information should I tell my psychologist so I can be prescribed meds that will help, but won’t take me to the hospital? Will they immediately take me into a hospital if I say that I’m suicidal?

selftext: But at times it feels like these are just fake feelings so I can pretend to sulk around and not get any kind of productive work done. I have no problem feeling happy or making others feel happy but every now and then I'll think about how much time I've wasted and how I could have done so much if I wasn't so fucking lazy.

I wish I had some kind of disorder, like autism, or actually being diagnosed with depression, so I had a reason to be so useless, but I continually feel like I'm just a terrible human being and that that's all there is to it.

That's all, just venting, and somehow I don't expect anything that comes from reddit will be able to help me.

selftext: How do you stop thinking constantly about the calories in food? If i look at an apple I just think 60 calories, if I look at a cup of yogurt I think 120 calories. I'm constantly doing math in my head and constantly worried about my intake. I'm sure this is just a part of having disordered eating (I've never been diagnosed, but I've always been obsessive). Any tips on how to work through this and eventually move on would be amazing. Some things I'm trying and they're sort of working (except I still do the math) are mindful eating, and allowing myself to have treats because I do workout and know that I need to eat more.

selftext: So I’ve been diagnosed with adhd the majority of my life, and I think I’ve got a pretty decent grasp of how it affects me. I’m just not sure how to tell the difference between “I have trouble with this/can’t do this as a result of my adhd or as a result of completely different factors” (example- laziness, general lack of trying, not having the right info or recourses, etc). I’m fine with adhd being part of my identity but I don’t want it to be the majority of my identity, and I don’t want to have to be like “well that thing I did was because of my adhd” if it really wasn’t and was something I could have preemptively changed.

Mandatory Information:

**Age**: 72

**Sex**: Male

**Height**:  ≈ 180cm

**Weight**: ≈ 100kg

**Race**: Caucasian

**Duration**:  ≈ a year\+

**Location**: Whole body except face

**Diagnosed Issues**: T1 bladder cancer \(no muscle invasion\), large prostate, high blood sugar

**Smoking**: Yes, long time

**Drugs**: GLUCOPHAGE and DIAMICRON to control blood sugar, started with ATARAX then public hospital changed it to XOZAL and then public hospital changed it to BILAZ to step down itchiness, BODERM KNESICALM cream and BUTAVATE cream for the skin which in the last visit to public hospital they said they will change those creams but didn't do yet. Lately he is under antibiotics for UTI and his prostate. Blood sugar drugs were administered long before skin stuff showed up as he had issues with blood sugar for around the past 5 years. Itchiness and skin drugs were administered only after the skin stuff showed up. Prostate and UTI drugs came long after the skin stuff when he was diagnosed with T1 BC.

\-\-\-\-

So to sum up his whole body besides face is covered in that stuff shown above for over a year now, he says they're itchy and most of the times in pain as well with them only getting worse with time \(bigger, more itchy, more painful\).

Public hospital for dermatological diseases said its autoimmune disease and that we should consult a psychologist but basically gave no cure or told us what exactly this is.

Psychologically he is sane, and he never had any mental issues.

We can't afford a paid hospital or doctor visits and he does not have any insurance besides public healthcare so I had to resign here.

Any clues on what this could be? Any direction? Really anything would be helpful.

Thank you

selftext: On my phone sorry for formatting yadda yadda 

Since I can remember I struggled with anxiety, depression etc but I never fully related to other people with depression and anxiety like myself. I felt helpless and alone, vulnerable to my actions and my mind. 

I was always an outcast at school, shunned by the other kids for my personality and inattentiveness to whatever game they were playing or thing they were doing, most things couldn’t capture my gaze. In high school I was capable of doing work but couldn’t maintain any kind of mental presence in the classroom or whilst trying to study. I would sit at my desk any cry over my work, I knew how to do it but trying to maintain a solid study session for more than 30 minutes I would feel absolutely incapable which would make me hate myself. 

The times that I did complete my work I would get top marks for, I knew that if I sat down and did all my work I could have everything finished early and have all of it be done without flaw, but I couldn’t. My mind would wander before I had the chance, I would put myself into my hobby’s, playing video games for the entirety of the day, constantly glued to my phone or have depressive naps for hours because if I couldn’t do anything well I would just choose to do nothing. 

I was medicated for anxiety and anti depressants, a bitter sweet cocktail of drugs over the years that made me feel detached yet would not hush the constant buzz of my mind. My confidence was low as well as my aspirations as I felt like my mind would never let me achieve the things I was capable of. 

I left school early and started to work, hospitality wasn’t so bad as I was constantly moving and simulated with 100 things to do, I started feeling somewhat better, at the job I was at anyways. after a couple years past I wanted a job that paid better. I went through 3 jobs in administration over the course of a year, contracts never extended, one I was dismissed from. I would pick up the role immediately as I was always intuitive and intelligent, yet the feedback I always got was ‘a distraction for those around her’ ‘seemingly unproductive’ ‘inefficient in the role’. 

Work was like torture. The buzz of my mind, constant agitation, getting distracted and doing something like talk or stare at something out the window, fidgeting, feeling the need to leave my desk, the list goes on. My own personal hell in a conveniently sized package of my own brain. I felt hopeless, vulnerable, not good enough, scared. 

At work I would drown myself in caffeinated drinks as they calmed me down. In social situations I was sedate myself with MDMA or weed in a fight to keep a conversation going with someone, to stop myself talking over others, interrupting, not listening to what they were saying, or oversharing in general. Any time I drank alcohol I would form into an exaggerated version of my already exaggerated self. 

I had been seeing the two same psychologist and psychiatrist since I started experiencing issues with my mental health at the young age of 13. ‘You have Anxiety and Depression’ is what I was told for years and years. At 19 years of age I stopped seeing these people as they were through a government service for children, seeing them privately was a pain as their adult clinic was limited. 

I saw a new psychologist and psychiatrist privately recently as I felt like I was at an all time low. After lamenting over my problems and what I wanted to achieve the psychiatrist asked if I had been diagnosed with ADHD before I said, no I’ve only ever been through [government service] he explained that the laws on diagnosing ADHD were very strict and that I may have been left undiagnosed for that reason. When I saw the psychologist they also asked if I had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. I was told to read up on ADHD and I did. I cried after reading first hand accounts of what it was like living with adult ADHD, so many things clicked into place. Seeing my psychiatrist again I was officially diagnosed. 

I have such a sense of relief as I feel like I’m not alone, I understand myself so much more which in itself is amazing. I hope that by lurking on this sub that I can understand and help myself even more than I’ve ever been able to. Thank you.

selftext: Hello all, made this account just for this sub. My son as mentioned was having issues (everything was boring, can't sit still, runs out of the class etc etc...) at school since kindergarten (age 4/5). Finally in March after another meeting with the school, we decided to get him into a psychiatrist. Lucky for us he was seen a month later! Several surveys and videos later, pre-appointment, and one hour in, yep ADHD. While at the meeting the doc mentioned the hereditary part!

While watching the videos and doing the surveys before the meeting, I was like holy shite, that's me too! I booked an appointment with my GP right after and she agreed that I should be tested. Apparently I even brought up the fact I thought I had ADD 3 years ago (which I don't remember).  She told me it may be tough finding a psych to diagnose though at this age (early 40s) as a lot don't want to prescribe stims!  I wasn't giving up, and finally we found a psych who would do a consult/diagnoses ONLY! Treatment would be followed up with the GP only after that. This is fine with me! 

I already am diagnosed with anxiety/depression and am somewhat apprehensive on getting stims as well the worry wart in me says NO! To make matters even worse I have a job offer from a good friend who works in a large corp, but they want me in before my assessment day. I'm currently employed and am in the usual boredom mode at my job and would love to change, but it would possibly mess up my and my friend's careers if I go in there and get - for lack of a better term - triggered.  Any suggestions for those that may have been in similar situations?

TL:DR - son 9 diagnosed, hereditary, I'm being tested in early July, new job offer wanting me to start ASAP. Feedback or can you relate?

selftext: Hello everyone. I cannot even begin explaining how long it took and how much energy I expended advocating for myself to get on an ADHD treatment plan. You see, I'm on the spectrum (ASD / Asperger's) and I was only diagnosed as an adult (with parents who told me I'd "grow out of it" as a child, treated as a normie). And while there aren't any meds for ASD itself, ADHD/Executive Functioning Disorder are huge burdens for the average person on the spectrum.

Anyway, I finally was diagnosed ADHD and after trying 4 medications that made things worse, I got on Adderall. From day one I can tell it made a huge freaking improvement. It's a 5mg dose, and I'm on day 6. 

I love cooking, and the kitchen is always a wreck. That causes tension in my marriage because my wife simply says, "Why can't you just clean as you cook? It's not that hard!" as if it's a button I can switch on. Well, last night when guests were over, I cooked a 6 course meal and my brain was locked onto cleaning as I cooked. Everything made sense. I felt like an efficient android. Like putting something away at the same time as taking something out, consolidating piles of dirty dishes, wiping up sections of the counter while I put a dirty plate away. I know it sounds silly, but this stuff means a lot to me because I love cooking and I could never get the cleaning right.

About the question. It's odd because I know Adderall is a stimulant, yet it makes me start to yawn like crazy about 30 minutes after my once-daily morning dose. It's a Yin-Yang scenario though, because I'm incredibly locked on target with focus, yet I'll be yawning. By noon-time I have to take a 15 minute nap! I have told this to my doctor and she's looking into it. It shocks her because she expected me to be "cracked out" or something. "You're tired when you should be stimulated, and you're hungry when you should have no appetite? Did I prescribe you the wrong thing? *jokingly*"

Does anyone know why that could be? TBH I'll take the tiredness if it means that the voices in my head die down, that I can stop beating myself up, and that my depression/anxiety fade away!

It's so nice to meet all of you... and it's so nice to finally get some help for my ADHD :)

I’ve been diagnosed with BPD for eight years now. The past three years or so I’ve become more anxiety ridden and have found myself staying home more and more. I use a daily app that encourages/keeps track of things I do (from brushing my teeth to leaving the house) and I haven’t left my house in over 3 weeks as of today. I also missed a therapy appointment this AM - I think it’s because deep down I didn’t want to leave my house, though I blamed it on being too tired. This was never a problem for me before, but now it’s ruining (what’s left) of my life.

Also, adult should be able to manage it without medicine and that if I can't function as an adult without medicine then I probably have maniac bipolar.

I've talked to 2 different psychiatrists, and more therapists than I remember, and a common theme has always goes back to ADHD. My psychiatrist believes that my ADHD is making me hyperfocus on these intrusive thoughts I've been having, which is creating anxiety, and thus derealization. This sounds quite weird to me, and I was wondering if there's much merit to this? If anyone has anything similar, how do you deal with it?

selftext: I don't know what to do, where to go, who I even am.  Everything my life was supposed to be ended decades ago and I never found myself again.  It didn't just end, it was stolen by greedy, narcissistic assholes.  I used to think it was abuse that made me so miserable, but I don't think it phased me.  I think it felt like love, being touched, wanted, desired.  Fucking hell the first time I had actual PIV sex with another girl I was 5, and I loved it.

The first time I was diagnosed as depressed was 1981.  My parents didn't want to hear about it.  The doc basically said my parents were fucked up and caused a great deal of my issues.  My dad walked out and never went back.  The only reason I am still alive is I never managed to die doing the stupid shit I used to do, and this overwhelming, uncontrollable refusal to kill myself.  I can't even consider it without this voice in my head telling me, "tomorrow might be the day it gets better...."  Maybe tomorrow is the day I get run over.

The only two things I have ever been good at are fucking and drinking.  At 50, on meds for OCD, and now ADHD, I don't have much of either anymore.  I thought finally getting diagnosed with ADHD would be the start of something great.  Nobody told me it would awaken the guilt of decades of a pissed away life and leave me more paralyzed than I already was.

I am over half fucking dead and I have nothing worth a shit.  Don't even have family that gives a shit.  My sister and parents are the narcissistic assholes who spent years fucking up my life.  My wife is as fucked up as I am and has her own fucking demons to deal with.  I have computer/porn addiction, and the goddamn porn doesn't even arouse me anymore.  I can't even make a coherent vent post... god I sound like a fucking idiot child.  Everything I have tried to be, realtor, welder, networking engineer, on and on, tech schools and colleges... waste of money and not a single success in any fucking thing!

selftext: Quick summary: suicidal thoughts but no plans or attempts to act on them. In therapy, psychiatry, on an anti-depressant, still finding the right pill/dosage over time. Diagnosed with anhedonia (if that's something to be "diagnosed" with)

What I understand the least about the depression and suicidal thoughts is that.. Why haven't I done it by now? I'm going to therapy, I'm seeking out help via psychiatrists and medications over the last few months. One psychiatrist asked me to fill out *8 pages* of mental health and medical history info (handwritten) - and *I filled it all out*. I have no idea why. No idea why I'd even bother.

I've made the assumption that it's my "survival instinct". There has to be some small part of me clinging for dear life to this.. realm of existence. But I don't understand why that part of me would work so hard to bother. It feels like an unconscious part of myself that I don't have control over and have no words to describe or understand

I don't know if any of that makes sense, but..... Thoughts?

---

Extra unorganized info, in case anyone is interested

One big thing preventing my suicide is that I'm allergic to pain. I don't want to do it with a knife or a rope. Pills - what if I do it wrong and wake up and feel pain from the overdose. Jumping off a high place - what if I land wrong and survive. Car exhaust - what if I choke on the fumes and suffocate. I feel a desire to have specific control over how I do it

So far my only solution is a gun. For the record, I don't own a gun or have access to one.. But I live in America. I could probably go to a nearby Walmart tonight and buy a gun no-questions-asked and off myself within the next hour or two. But I won't do that. I have no real urge to do it. And that's the part I don't understand.

Part of it, I think, is that.. If I held the key to this door I've thought about going through for over two years, I fear I might use the key right away. So I hold off on obtaining it until I either have a desire to live again, or I think of a different solution that lets me die painlessly but still relatively soon. I don't understand what exactly I'm waiting for or why I'm waiting at all.. but I'm stuck waiting.

selftext: I imagine some people here might find this to be useful information. A couple weeks ago I started this depression therapy called "Deep TMS" which stands for "transcranial magnetic stimulation". From what the psychiatrist told me, the device pulses magnetic fields into the frontal lobe which has shown to have significant clinical effect on mood for some people.   
  
This is the exact device they use at the new clinic here in L.A. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT-CWYi4Spk So far, for me, it's been really interesting and has definitely brought a lift. The people who started the clinic are in recovery themselves and one of them witnessed his little brother go through the therapy years ago which was very transformative for him and obvious to everyone around him. It's pretty weird and futuristic imho. Zaps you once ever 15 seconds for 20 minutes and you attend every day for a month excluding weekends. It doesn't hurt per say but the right side of face contorts a bit with each zap.  
   
    
Although I've only done 6 treatments so far, I've noticed a slight lift in what I'd call my baseline mood. One significant observation is how I feel when I wake up. I tend to be extra funky after sleep, regardless of how much I get, where I basically don't want to get out of bed or do anything making it a real chore. That is changing which is very interesting and obvious. Throughout the day I've also felt more animated and active which has been commented on by a few people with whom I work as well.   
  
To be approved for this type of therapy by insurance (full disclosure, I'm actually on a scholarship with deferred cash pay and am not currently diagnosed with major depressive disorder) you need to have been diagnosed with depression with a couple classes of meds in your medical record. The people seeking this are typically what they call "treatment resistant" although this current clinic is definitely of a addiction/recovery theme so far. The people who founded it are very much into using modern tools like neurofeedback and TMS and see recovery treatment in the vein of brain/mood optimization/healing. I told them about IV NAD+ and hoping they offer that someday too!  
  
  
Just thought I'd share. I'll further update down the road. :)

selftext: Basically, I've been meaning to get tested for ADD for about 3-4 years, but my parents never got around to taking me. During middle school and my early high school years, I definitely struggled with intention, but everything was relatively easy to me to the point where I'd barely study and still do really well, so it wasn't much of an issue. I'm a junior now and my amount of work and studying has nearly tripled since last year. I've fallen way behind in school, my memory is terrible and totally unreliable. My attention span is way worse. I always have hundreds of thoughts racing through my mind, keeping my focus during class, when I try to do homework, or even just talking to someone face to face is nearly impossible. 

So after finally getting my parents to take me to someone who could diagnose me, I sat for 4 hours (2 and 2) doing one of those standardized ADD tests. I found the content to be rather easy because I don't really struggle with language or grammar, what I really struggle with is keeping straight focus and especially memory. All in all, the test concluded that I am NOT ADD since I'm a fast paced when it comes to working on short tasks, they tested that my IQ was above average in all sections, but way below average under the memory and attention portion.

 So my question comes down to how reliable these tests are, and how was your diagnosis?

I was really hoping to sit down and explain the things I feel to my psychologist (she said all she does are tests), I really don't think that a test like this summarizes and accurately diagnoses my struggles, especially considering how these things can affect different people. After thoroughly reading this subreddit I've read so many accounts that almost exactly sum up what I have been dealing with. Although I'm a good/above average student, I've always know that I can do better, whether that's getting extra time on SATs or taking medication during the school day. I really don't know how to explain this to my parents and psychologist, I KNOW this isn't something as stupid as "you're just too disorganized" and it really bothers me to think that I could drastically improve my life if I just received some extra support. What should I do?

selftext: Last December I took 50 10mg seroquel pills. I knew beforehand that it wouldn't be fatal, and I've finally come to terms that I did it for attention. I feel horrible, I know there are so many people who  really feel hopeless enough to permanently end their lives and I kinda feel like the stereotypical melodramatic, ungrateful, privileged teenager.

I've been watching Girl, Interrupted, and a line that Valerie says to Susanna really resonated with me: “a *lazy*, *self*\-*indulgent* little girl who is driving herself crazy." I'm afraid that that's exactly what I'm doing. Not sure if this is useful to note, but I'm an INFP \(as Susanna is often typed as\).

I go to an academically selective school \(Syd, Australia\) and I've been tutored since I was 8. I've had music lessons and sporting opportunities. I feel like my life is good \(though I've had a lot of family issues, but that's a whole other story\), but I still feel hopeless and sad. While I was quite academic up until grade 6, as soon as I started high school it all went downhill. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist, and I think it's a major key to my depression \+ anxiety.

I'm waiting to get my prescription approved, and during this week I've sorta done nothing. It feels like I'm almost in limbo. I'm hoping that Ritalin will 'cure' me, but I know it's unrealistic. I feel a dread that I'll be part of the 20&amp;#37; who don't respond to stimulant medication, due to my fatalism and belief that I'm haunted with bad luck \(there goes the melodrama\).

I've gotten really off track, sorry about that. But back to my 'suicidal gesture', the guilt is eating me up. I know this really effected my family, and my sister especially \(also suffered from depression\). I wan't to talk about it with someone, but I'm worried my psychologist won't take me seriously any more.

But I don't regret it. I had been depressed for 4 years, and while my parents had an inkling they never asked about it. I never received professional help. I doubt I would have been diagnosed with ADHD if my parents hadn't realised the severity of my issues \(I believe my anxiety stems from add\).

Sorts just pouring out my feelings here...my progress with my psychologist has plateaued.

selftext: Not sure if anyone has a similar situation or can give feedback based on their treatment so here goes.

I was diagnosed with ADHD twice, as a child and then teenager, but my parents were anti-medication. My early memory isn't great and so I didn't really consider that ADHD was a problem for me until about 2-3 years ago. I was finally diagnosed this year (late twenties) and began treatment a few months ago.

I began vyvanse titration and am now up to the maximum dose of 70mg/day. 20mg didn't really help. 40mg was like night and day. I was able to manage bad behaviors, but tended to have a crash around 3pm when taking my dose at 10:00am. 70mg enhanced the positive effects and I was able to take my dose between 7-9am and would not crash until around 10-11pm, which is great for my work schedule now.

Recently, I've noticed it getting more difficult to manage my bad behaviors and I'm having trouble focusing and engaging around 3/4 through my day. I feel like I'm having a mini-crash around 6:00pm and the 10:00pm crash is becoming much more severe.

My ADHD specialist pointed out my extremely high caffeine intake around my diagnosis and advised me that I was self medicating with the only readily available stimulant. I lowered my caffeine intake as soon as I started treatment but I'm starting to need more to be able to focus through my day.

I'm not sure if this is indicating that I'm over an initial hurdle of getting the most out of the medication and starting to become accustomed and should look into adding a booster to finish the day out strong when needed or if I'm just not managing bad behavior as well as when I first began treatment.

I'll be speaking with my Dr. regardless but I'm not sure if the adderall booster, or some other behavior management strategies are going to be most effective. If anyone has a similar experience when beginning treatment, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - Began treating for ADHD three months ago, been taking 70mg vyvanse for two months and I'm noticing a sudden dip in effectiveness. More drugs or just be better?

I am very good friends with someone who is diagnosed ADHD-PI. He cannot stand my fidgets and physical tics, although am sympathetic as to why. But recently he told me that he thinks that I should and can work on eliminating all of my physical tics. However i tried to explain to him that this has been impossible for me, in that the moment I stop concentrating on a physical tic or work on stopping one, another simply develops in its place. Through my life, it has gone from nail rubbing, to leg tapping, to hair pulling, to vocal tics, and many many more. He simply couldn't understand that I can't eliminate this innate desire to keep myself busy either mentally or physically, since I almost always do these things when bored. Has anyone else experienced odd conflicts/stigmatization between yourself and others with different forms of ADHD?

selftext: I need advice, I hope I’m looking in the right place. Please excuse the formatting, I’m on mobile.
I work full time as a one-year old teacher at a daycare. About a week ago, I noticed an itchy rash on my arm. I happened to have a doctors appointment and they diagnosed it as ringworm and prescribed an antifungal cream. I am almost certain I picked it up at the daycare.

I let my boss know of the diagnosis and that it was being treated. I did not expect much from her as this daycare consistantly has outbreaks such as pink eye due to being lax about doctors clearance notes, and management typically recommending we do not send kids home despite fever or other symptoms. She told me she would let the parents know there was at least “one case” of ringworm in the classroom. She didn’t.

I treated it over the weekend, but when I came back to work I noticed that most of the kids in my classroom are now covered in a ringworm like rash, seemingly a lot worse than mine. I have also noticed it on children in classrooms that interact with mine throughout the day. These children are under 2 years old. I am at a loss as to what I should do.

Will we keep reinfecting eachother? Is there anything I can do to prevent it from spreading? Will the children be okay if they aren’t treating it? Should I overstep my boss’s boundaries and let parents know? Should I be making a phone call to licensing?

I love my job and these kids, I am concerned. Thank you for reading.

TLDR: Ringworm outbreak at daycare, parents are unaware or possibly just not bothered. What can/should I do?

selftext: [I made this post yesterday but got no response, so I thought I'd try again]

I’ve noticed something in myself I want to share as I think it’s an ADHD-related issue. For the record, I am diagnosed with the condition and am better trying to understand what defines it for me, and how to cope.

Recently, I’ve become more aware of a problem I believe I’ve had for most of life. I have trouble accessing emotions (i.e. sadness), or more accurately, holding onto emotions for any period of time. Within 5-10 seconds of becoming tearful, I realize I’ve become distracted. My mind is elsewhere, already having followed a thought chain several links beyond whatever thoughts were initially causing me to feel that emotion.

This pattern really frustrates me. I worry it delays my process of really feeling what I need to feel, and more immediately, it causes me grief that I can’t easily hang onto an important feeling.

I understand the perspective of “there’s no wrong way to access feelings,” but for me at least, this feels wrong. I’ve been told it’s good that I recognize the pattern, and that I want to change it.

I can see it being partly a defense mechanism, a knee-jerk avoidance of unpleasant feelings, possibly fueled by a shame of crying. But it really seems to me to be of similar nature to other ADHD thought processes, of distraction and mental disorganization, of mentally getting ahead of yourself, of being unable to slow this ceaseless mental leapfrog, and often not realizing it.

Does anyone share this experience? Any solutions or strategies to better holding onto feeling?

selftext: I'm posting this through mobile, so if the format is strange I apologise in advance.

I have been diagnosed with depression and ptsd from childhood sexual abuse this year. This is my third therapist that I've talked to about it in the past year and half.

I hate recalling the abuse so much, but my therapist actually makes me feel like I take a step forward after each session. We have been seeing each other once a week and I've also been taking Zoloft to help manage my life. 

I'm leaving for a family vacation this weekend and she was all about seeing me before I went. Two hours before the appointment I get a call from the receptionist saying she has cancelled our session today with no explanation. It was over voicemail though and I haven't contacted her back yet. I'm trying to calm down, because I don't trust what I would say. I'm very upset.

I have horrible problems with abandonment alongside depression, panic attacks, etc. After listening to the voicemail I got those feelings all over again. I'm not worth anyone's time. Telling a 'stranger' about my abuse is already humiliating. My family and friends were the people to convince me to see someone. I never wanted to go through this. I was happy pushing it aside. 

Has this ever happened to anyone? How did you cope? I won't be seeing her until May 15. I also want to point out that she doesn't give out a way to reach her after office hours and she is constantly late to our appointments. I feel very disrespected, but also trying to understand that she's human and life happens.

I’ve had a cough since December. Originally presented as a sinus infection—snot, coughing, no fever. OTC cough meds didn’t help, antihistamines didn’t help, humidifier didn’t help. Got antibios and Tesselon which calmed it for a while. Then around February it came back. GP said it was likely a post viral cough and that it’d fade away. Well...it didn’t. Finally caved and went to the ENT at the end of March. Got a laryngoscope and was diagnosed with thrush on my vocal cords and had wax extracted from one ear where it was pressing on a nerve. Got an Rx for anti fungal lozenges and went for follow up, thrush has cleared. Cough abated a while. 

Well, now it’s back. Mostly at night, as always. I’ll lie down and be fine but will soon get an irresistible twinge in my throat and will cough to the point of almost feel like vomiting. I wake up two or three times at night and cough like this. I’ve been flushing my sinuses with a rinse to eliminate nasal congestion but it never seems to last long enough to let me sleep. 

I’m miserable and exhausted. The two ENT visits are going to run me about $400 even with insurance so I don’t want to go back if I can help it...but I also don’t know what to do. Could it be persistent thrush? Or something else? If it were just allergies I’d think the Allegra and Nasonex would nuke it. Thank you for any help.

selftext: How do some of you remind yourself of this? 
I love my husband, he’s my whole world. But lately when he’s manic he’s a completely different person. I can usually wrangle him in long enough to get him thinking clearly, then I’ll say something and he feels attacked, which immediately leads to yelling and screaming. I try my hardest to be patient and remain calm, but yesterday I told him what he said was sounding irrational (my mistake....). It immediately went to yelling then him telling me things I know he would never say normally. (He’s on reddit so I’m keeping it vague)  But in the back of my mind I have to fight the thought he’s using it as an excuse to say these things. 
I know he’s not, I know he adores me and the kids. 
He’s on new meds, and I know that takes time. I’m patient. I understand he’s having a rough time with this as well. I understand it’s hard. So hard. But gosh darn it if I don’t want to lock him in the closet on days like this. 

I also probably should have started with this, but the anger is a new development. He was diagnosed a few months ago, but I’ve never seen this out of him so it’s also terrifying. I was able to calmly tell him this morning that how he’s acted is frightening, but I feel like he just wrote me off then blamed me for him getting angry. 

He has therapy today and I’m going with him. It’s his first session. (Any advice on first therapy sessions are more ham welcome. My anxiety is through the roof)

I take adderall 3x a day (10mg), and have been diagnosed with social anxiety, depression, and ADHD

I've always had paranoia, like a sense that people are behind me or around me occasionally and sometimes i have moments where i can't convince myself there's nothing there. I've never experienced visual hallucinations, but I do hear things that aren't there or misplaced sounds (like if something is to the left of me, i hear it far behind me and it sounds like something else)


Lately it's been getting worse, the past few days or so. I've actually been sleeping more recently (7-8 hours as opposed to 5-6) but people have said the dark circles under my eyes are worse, etc. I'm not under that much more stress now except for AP testing so I don't know why that would affect it.


A few days ago, my vision completely blacked out when I stood up, and slowly faded back in but was fuzzy. I've been feeling disoriented frequently, and when I was walking earlier had a feeling that the floor wasn't there. I feel like something is surrounding me and watching me at all time and it's awful. I've also been hearing whistling and more of the misplaced sounds than I've heard before.


I can't really go to a doctor, as my mother is the r/raisedbynarcissists type and tends to believe anything, especially mental issues is just me over exaggerating or freaking out. She tends to also think things have easy solutions and gets mad at me for coming to her with issues, so I'm not really sure what to do. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

selftext: I was once diagnosed with OCD but I still doubt that diagnosis. Because that is permanent and what I have seems to come and go.

It’s back now and I find it hard to explain what exactly is going on. It’s like a mix of depression and very specific, obsessive thoughts. Everything feels hopeless, I don’t care about life anymore. I always begin to think of suicide and all I do all day is lie in bed and browse the internet. 

Whenever I’m in this ‘phase’, it feels like my life will always be like this. I am not my outgoing self anymore. Work suddenly becomes ten times as hard. Simple tasks take forever. Talking to people feels like a huge burden. I begin to question reality itself because the thoughts that are in my head make no sense. I begin to lose my sense of logic.

But then... it always disappears. I somehow transition back into a somewhat ‘normal’ state of mind. With or without meds. I still think of the thoughts but they lose their intensity. It’s like I am able to live again.

But it’s scary to live like this. And while my life has become better compared to 8 years ago, I still feel like I lack stability. Because it always comes back. Always.

I feel like I should start therapy again but it’s always so hard because I feel like I can’t properly explain my situation. Especially not when I’m in a normal mood. And when I’m a bad phase, I simply don’t go. I’ve done this a lot in the past.

so basically, I'll get to vent at the end, just wanted to have this out of the way first, how do you manage to work on tasks you worked on before? I seem to have memory problems, and am thinking of writing stuff down, basically step by step how things are done. Do you think that would help?

/rantstart

My situation is the following. Started on the PhD, my supervisors came over today, and were partially disappointed with the amount of work done. The things they tell me to help me along the way were the same things as before, but I honestly totally forgot about them. Example: in order to start on the thesis you need to define the problems. In order to define the problems you need to work through examples iterativelly. So, I got the first part, but the examples I totally forgot about. And when one of my supervisors told me that I need to pick up the pace I remember he told me the exact same thing at the start of the previous projects we did. That, plus some other questions we talked about, makes me think I really have problems remembering. This makes me so mad, because I am trying, but I am always prepared to screw something up. Maybe it needs to be taken into account that I suspected I have aspergers only a month ago and am soon to be diagnosed (with whatever I might have), so I should look at this in a positive way, an opportunity to use my new found "skill" (asperger).

I am diagnosed with ADHD and depression and used to heavily medicate with alcohol \(to stop my inner monologue\). I now take benzo in the worst case of an anxiety attack and milnacepran versus the depression.

My main problem seems to be that I am a sponge for affection. That muffles any woman I have a sincere interest in which understandably drives them away. Usually I'm then sad about it for a week, cry about it to my close friends, and move on at some point.

Now an ex intimate partner is intimate with another one in our same social circle. This is totally fine with me on a rational level, as they both are wonderful people. She is also a close friend and currently the only one I turn to for sympathy, which of course is too much for her and she pointed that out to me.

I also feel like I overplay my distress: I \(used to \-\- I'm planning on seriously not drinking for the next weeks or months at least\) leave empty wine bottles rolling on the floor, sleep on the couch on purpose, make sure only those who I want sympathy from see the scratch marks on my arm.

Apparently I like myself in that victim's role, and if I break away from it I'm afraid of two things: One, that I fail and hate myself even more for that, and two, that I won't get any affection whatsoever afterwards, not even a sympathy hug.

Has anyone else had that problem, and even better so: Overcome it?

I’m 19 and recently found out I have BPD but I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 13 and, having some meds leftover from when I used to take ADHD meds, I took about 20 of them yesterday. I don’t know the dosage, and at the time of taking them didn’t really care. I was not trying to hurt myself but I wasn’t concerned about my well being or what would happen. I just wanted to feel normal feelings. At first I felt all relaxed but now I’ve been throwing up and having panic attacks and unable to eat or sleep. My mom is going to take me to the ER when she gets home. I feel like a horrendous burden and stresser to my mom’s life. She knows I am sick but doesn’t really understand in what ways, and we have a lot of conflicts and confusion because of it, especially since I have not had BPD treatment (I am currently looking for a new psychiatrist, just moved). I don’t want to go to the hospital. I usually don’t make really bad decisions like this. I just feel awful and I need to vent to a community who understands. I am a total underachiever. I failed out of college even though I am very smart. My relationships with others are difficult to maintain despite me being charismatic. I’ve had emotional problems from a very young age and have been chronically suicidal since 13. I guess what I really need is just someone to reassure things get better with treatment before I go to the ER.

What about someone perfectly healthy who suddenly becomes manic at the age of 24 and starts experiencing hallucinations, having never been told that "this is part of who you are"?. What about the fact that the suicide rate of those with such diagnoses is much higher than someone who hasn't? What if the stigma here is a major stressor that can drastically change that person's decision making ability. I was part of a program that allowed doctors to screen patients in third world countries that needed heart surgery and then flew them to developed nations to receive treatment. Those individuals were most often from places such as Nigeria, and their attitude towards illness is drastically different. Someone who would be a homeless schizophrenic In California was instead a Shaman in town who had a societal role that encompassed their psychosis.

People in the US can be on medications for such things, but it is a choice, and the recovery rates seen in those who take medications is vastly different than those who don't. I've seen first hand someone who was nearly destitute and rejected medication and then when they finally have a regimen they improve greatly. It isn't a perfect science as we don't understand the brain and it's workings as well as we understand other things such as the heart or lungs. You can pull your quotes from the 1 or 2 doctors who are fighting against the evidence but that doesn't make you right. It's like anti vaccers quoting the one doctor who made the claim to the autism to vaccinations against literally the entire scientific community. Cling to whatever you can to try and convince yourself you are right, meanwhile people in the field and examining the data are against you

selftext: Does anyone else struggle with sleep issues since getting sober? I certainly have, and almost 2 years in I'm still trying to figure out ways to get a really good night's sleep. 

For about the first year and a half of sobriety I was able to fall sleep no problem, but my sleep was never refreshing. My ex told me that I'd toss and turn all night, expending energy when I should have been getting rest. I got a sleep study done and was diagnosed with hypersomnia, but they couldn't find a reason for my chronic exhaustion. The doctor tried pushing amphetamines on me! Ha! That wasn't happening 😂

Recently, though, I've been having trouble FALLING asleep. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved out, and now I'm living out of a single room that I'm renting in a townhouse. As soon as I lay down to fall asleep I get hit with a real panicked feeling, and have to spend the next hour meditating and trying to reassure myself that I'm not going crazy. I'd be lying if I told you it doesn't take its toll on my mental health. 

My therapist postulates that it's because I have complex PTSD from my childhood (later exacerbated by excessive drug and alcohol abuse). I take melatonin before bed, and I do try to exercise on top of the work I do outside every day. But goddamn do I wish I could figure out this issue. I envy those who's sleep improved when they got clean! 

Can anyone else relate? And if so, how have you been able to improve your sleep?

selftext: I'm still adjusting to the idea that my psychiatrist is right about ADHD despite not having any clinical symptoms as a child. A few years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar so ADHD would be another layer of mental illness fuckery I might not have the strength to manage.

So I was looking more in-depth at the symptom list to try and find reasons to not accept my diagnosis, then the term 'rejection sensitive dysphoria' pops up and I feel like I've been exposed.

It's the worst thing about me and because of how sensitive I am to rejection it's set my life back more than impulsivity or memory issues. In the recent past I had a terrible and prolonged 'rejection' event and I can't let it go. It fills me with rage and anxiety almost everyday but no matter the distractions my brain wants me to remember every detail, to fight them in my imagination, and half the time I still lose. Personality-wise I'm agreeable and polite but I learned these things from my very mother (just a shy person, not ADHD). My politeness goes overboard when my anxiety increases.

As far as rejection dysphoria goes it isn't known as a symptom of bipolar, or even defined at all by the DSM, which means ADHD is likely. 

**How are you coping? Is there's a good treatment for this?** Help with this could make me just functional enough to live an independent life. I've been great at managing mental illness over the years but this could actually put me in a psych ward if it turns into paranoia.

selftext: Okay, I want to cheer everyone up here since I see a lot of frustrated and sad people on this subreddit. I want you all to feel confident and self reliant in your life which is what I did for myself.


I used to be a really depressed person. I was bullied, abused, and neglected. I've also had a lot of health struggles from being diagnosed with GAD to having a concussion that took over 5 years of intense therapy to heal from and also, some fitness issues I fixed with my own workouts. I used to not have any friends, felt that nobody cared, and I was just an aimless person. 


I changed for myself. Not for anyone else. I got fit, became more motivated, found the things I love, and people have gravitated to me because of it. I have 2 great friends and will likely be getting a girlfriend soon. To cap it all off, I had a phone call a few days ago and I may be getting my dream job in professional racing. I can't say much about it for my privacy but I just might get it and make the big bucks racing stupid fast cars for a living. I had been told so many times I could never do it, I wasn't born for this, and I would fail. Well, it sure isn't looking that way.


Anyways, back to the point. I hope all of you find peace in your issues. Find what makes you a motivated and happy person, work on the issues you have, and be tenacious and relentless in your pursuit of happiness. It may take only a few days or a few years but you will come to a place of joy.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed a bilateral pars interaticularis fracture with grade 1 spondylolisthesis following an injury at track practice. I've done PT many times without major success, but really just live and manage symptoms pretty well. 

I had [x-Ray and MRI images](https://imgur.com/a/TdQfH) done which showed the spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis along with two disc herniations I believe. [This](https://imgur.com/a/MWW8l) is my radiography report. If you can interpret it further for me, that would be greatly appreciated. 

More recently, I've had continued back pain. For the most part, it's manageable but I'm *always* uncomfortable. Feels like a 100 pound weight is on top of my head squashing me. I also just graduated nursing school. Yikes!

I’m currently having a massive flare up. It feels *mostly* muscular, but painful irregardless. I know what provoked it — I was carrying a child and she jumped into my arms. Right now, I have pain that limits my ROM and makes me walk a little funny.

I’m taking both Tylenol and ibuprofen (limited because I know it’s an anti inflammatory but also struggle with gastritis). Some slight stretching but nothing crazy. Just taking it easy... 

Any advice or recommendations would be so helpful — Am I doing everything I can? Just need to ride it out? Would it be inappropriate to visit urgent care for a muscle relaxer? 

Thank you!

The way she laughs just makes me smile. She’s so cute like a little cherry blossom in the spring. She’s special, like s porcelain statue I want to keep forever. I just want to wrap her in my arms and just keep her in my embrace. But I can’t. I fucking can’t. Because she has a jealous ass boyfriend who came crying back to her causing her to break off another relationship. Maybe it’s not him but my salty ass. I just don’t understand. All I want to be with is her. Just her comfort would relieve my shaking soul. Nothing else would quench my thirst for happiness. Instead I sit here continuously withering away. And I hope she and her now again boyfriend live in peace. While I slowly die inside. I love her so much. Like it’s unreal. I want to make her so happy that she forgets about her pain. But instead I’m on the sidelines watching her suffer. I want to help. Is that too much to ask? All I wanna do is help. That’s all. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I try to stay loyal as best as I can

selftext: Tldr: considering trying nonstimulant ADHD meds. Have you made the switch from stimulant to nonstimulant? More questionsat the bottom. 

Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 13, I'm 30 now. I was part of the generation of children that psychiatrists threw stimulant drugs at. I took Adderall XR for 5 years, my psychiatrist increased my dose whenever I said anything about it not working as well as it had previously. For the last two years of my Adderall years I was taking 90mg every morning with a 10mg Ritalin chaser in the afternoon. It was a lot. I barely slept and rarely ate. I took a good look at my life and decided that I didn't want to live that way. 

So I went cold turkey and it sucked. I basically had to learn to focus on my own, I had gotten so used to leaning on my medication. The withdrawals were terrible and I never want to go through that again. Now that it's been many years I'm thinking about going back and getting my MS in Library Sciences. It's a tough degree and I still have a hard time focusing. I'm scared of going back because I worry that I won't be able to keep up with the work load and maintain the focus necessary. 

Sorry for the rambling, but I want to know if anyone here has made the switch from stimulant to nonstimulant ADHD meds? Do they work as well for you? What do you take and what do you like about it? Do you find that it affects your sex drive?

selftext: TL;DR Been taking 18 mg Concerta for two weeks and have been experiencing paradoxically effects 

(I’m aware that this isn’t a substitute for medical advice. My current psychiatrist barely agreed to prescribe the medicine after having me on Klonopin which made my life hell. Just looking for some advice :) ) 

I have been taking 18 mg Concerta for two weeks after being diagnosed with ADHD. Despite having all the symptoms of ADHD, I always thought I had bipolar due to the (subtle) mood changes. It’s been a relief browsing this subreddit and relating to everyone’s stories! The medicine increases my ability to focus tremendously and I feel like I can finally see after the fog clears. But I’m having some side effects that seem to counter the common ones on the internet. 

Before starting the medicine, I had a very high heart rate and was constantly anxious about my inability to complete tasks. When I started the medicine, my heart rate drops to around 60-70 bpm which is the opposite of what usually happens on a stimulant. I get very cold and extremely calm. I used to “never shut up” but on the medicine I can go a whole car ride without talking much. I also don’t have that much loss of appetite or weight loss. When the medicine wears off, I experience a terrible crash and all the effect I experienced without the medicine come back. 

I’m not complaining about the side effects, I enjoy being calm and relaxed with the ability to concentrate for the first time in my life. I’m just curious if anyone else has experience similar effects? 

Thanks :)

selftext: A little background on myself first:  when I was I  college, I went through some heavy emotional stuff. Stopped going to classes, stopped leaving my dorm, wasn't eating much and began smoking cigarettes excessively (the only time I really left my room was to smoke out front). I wasnt necessarily sad, I just felt kind of empty and lost. My academics suffered tremendously. Once the RA and administrative staff figured out what was going on, they recommended I go to the school counseling center to try to get to the bottom of things and also to see if there was any way to get out of the hole I had dug. At the center, I was initially diagnosed with depression. I kind of blew it off and did what they asked as far as getting back on my feet with school. I had to drop 3 classes and lost My funding for school. I never returned to college after that year. 

Then 3 years later, (im not going to go into too much detail on this) i intentionally overdosed and was found by my ex's mom at my apartment, who then got me medical attention. I spent a mandatory 3 days in the psych ward, and an extra 2 voluntarily. There, I was diagnosed with major depression. They suggested I stay awhile to figure things out,  but I refused and instead accepted a plan to go to counseling and take some medications. I never did. 

Now

A few weeks ago, my boyfriend confided in me that he believes I suffer from bipolar disorder. He said that he has been noticing that I go through "highs and lows".. he isn't in any sort of medical or psychological profession, but has had first hand experience all his life with relatives who suffered from bp, his dad and half sister. 

We didn't talk much about it. I was kind of taken back by what he said. It was out of nowhere but I guess it's something he had been thinking for awhile now. 
Prior to the day he told me, I had basically been sleeping all day and night, pretty much locked in the guest room with the exception of getting up to feed and take care of my 1 year old. I wasn't really showering either. This went on for a few days, I think a week. 
Then one day I was just full of energy so I started doing stuff around the house. I hung up pictures. I painted some picture frames. I had taken my son out back to play and also took him for a drive. I cleaned the entire house top to bottom, did laundry.  I moved our living room furniture around. I cooked lunch and dinner before my boyfriend got home. I organized the pantry. Some other small things. 
He got home and seemed a little weirded out by all of this. I was happy to see him and was hugging him  gave him a kiss. Apparently was talking a lot and kind of at a fast pace. 
Then he said "are you going through a high right now?" 
I was confused and he explained that he had been wondering if I was bi polar. 

We haven't talked about it since that day, but it has really been bothering me. Idk how I would know, and I have never been diagnosed with it, but I have been with depression. 

I'm not sure what steps to take from here or if I should even pay attention to this concern. I live in a different state now, and Im not sure of what to do or who to contact about this. Could he be right in his observations? It would be great to here from.people who suffer from or know people who suffer from bpdisorder. 

TLDR: my boyfriend is concerned that I may have bipolar disorder and I am unsure of what steps to take from here, or if I should even pay mind to his remarks. 

Edit: I'm sure someone will notice i posted husband in the title but referred as boyfriend in the text. He refers to himself as my husband, but we are not legally married. I guess my brain just didn't think about it? We've lived together over a year and common law applies to us.

selftext: So much is happening and I'm really overwhelmed and I don't know how to deal with this or feel.
Breakdown of events leading to this panic attack:
1) met an amazing girl a monthish ago, started dating on Sunday. She is amazing, too amazing for me and I completely adore her.
2) My 13 year old dog has been getting ill the last few months, getting increasingly worse we've been talking about putting her down once Dad had the funds, he does now and the date is set for Monday.
3) I'm getting assessed for autism spectrum disorder on Friday, I have already begun to be assessed for bpd they're waiting until my next appointment to diagnose it.
The last few days with my girl have been amazing, even last week before we started dating just everything about her is wonderful. Over the course of the week I helped her move, made her dinner and cookies, she asked me to be her girlfriend Sunday morning and I took her on a date in the evening. The last couple days together have been wonderful, she's everything I look for in a girl, smart, creative, great work ethic, respectful and oh so caring. I am 20, she 28 neither of us mind he age difference but I am just finishing highschool after dropping out 5 times, only have a part time job on the weekends, still live with my Dad since I can't afford to move out until I have a full time job, am at the best point in my recovery with mental health but I'm still fucked. Then there's my dog, I thought I was prepared for this, I lost my other dog last spring but now that the date is set I can't help but hate the decision and want to hold onto her forever but that would be cruel to her. And to top it all off I'm getting assessed for asd on Friday, it looks like I'll be diagnosed and I thought I had accepted it but now I can't help but think how is this gonna change the way my girl sees me? She says it won't and she supports me no matter the diagnosis but she is so amazing and has her life together and I'm only just getting there. She is so wonderful and I think I'm falling in love with her but I can't allow myself to, it's too early on, I can't let myself do it but I also don't know how to stop myself. I'm an emotional wreck right now, I have to lose my furbaby, I'm terrified of losing my girlfriend and I don't know how to deal with any of this. I'm staying at her place monday afterwards, I'm an emotional wreck already and its only gonna get worse, what if she can't handle how much of an emotional wreck I am? Everything is happening all at once and it's really overwhelming, I work Friday night and Saturday so I'm barely gonna sleep Sunday so I can have as much time with my old girl as possible before I have to say goodbye, I have almost no time to prepare for the assessment or euthanasia and my girlfriend is gonna be the only one to console me but what if it's too much for her? What if it makes her hate me? I don't know how I'm gonna come back to my house after having both my puppies gone forever, I don't know how to deal with the assessment. I'm terrified of everything right now. What do I do?

I haven’t been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD or anything (although a couple people have said I exhibit symptoms) but people with it have trouble sticking to a single task right?

It bothers me specifically with when I try read books - I have the drive to want to read books but I can never read more than a paragraph before doing something else because of a mixture of losing interest and my mind fixating on something else a minute later

Are there some tips to improve reading or I guess just attention span since that falls under the same tree of problems? Ty

I am having obsessive thoughts that I can not control and I have done unspeakable acts to make sure he won’t leave my life.

selftext: Hi everyone,

So I've just recently been diagnosed with ADHD \(I'm an 17 year old female btw\) and my psychiatrist is planning to put me on Ritalin, 20mg twice a day \(but gradual increase to reach that\). Australia is pretty strict when it comes to stimulant medication, and the ministry of health has to approve prescription for people under 18 so I haven't tried Ritalin yet. Also, only Dextroamphetamine, Vyvanese, Concerta and Ritalin are available to prescribe here.

I've read quite a few threads and from what I've gathered, Ritalin doesn't seem all that effective in comparison to Adderall. I'm getting pretty anxious about this, and I was just wondering what your experience with this is, wether your in Australia also and can't get adderall, or if you choose to use Ritalin.

Thanks :\)

You see, I'm a communist. Wherever I find other communities of communists online, whether leftypol or Facebook, I always find that a majority are on the spectrum. 

I know it's not just leftists either, because before I became one I was actually more involved in far-right politics, even proudly identifying as a fascist at one point. Admittedly, the only big far-right community I was involved with was pol, but I saw the same thing there. And this isn't me just assuming their diagnoses, this is them saying it.

In my current PHP I have yet to get a diagnosis and everyone has one. It makes me feel bad like I’m too difficult or that I’m untreatable since they can’t call it anything, or that some just don’t care.

I’m so lonely, yet I constantly push people away (my guess is because I don’t feel like I’m good enough for them, but I’m not completely sure.) I’m not suicidal again, thankfully, but I just feel constantly afraid of and disappointed in myself. I have no idea what to do. Thanks for listening to my late night babbling.

selftext: I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Over the past few months, it’s gotten a lot worse. I have been to the emergency room 4 separate times because I thought I was having a heart attack. 

Most recently, I was at work yesterday around 11:30 and all of a sudden, my chest got really tight and my heart rate and blood pressure shot way up. I immediately went to the ER. They did an EKG and chest x-ray and diagnosed me with costochondritis. Tonight I had a similar episode where my chest got tight and my heart pounded. I was able to deep breathe and it went back to normal. My doctor said my EKG was perfect. I’ve never had cardiac issues, but I can’t shake the fact that there’s something they’re overlooking.

selftext: Like, nobody truly cares in this world it seems like, people only need themselves. Nobody ever wants to be around me for being gay or being too much to deal with or just cause they hate me, relationships suck, love is a tease we see on movies, and the light is fading. Does anyone even know if all of this shit we're diagnosed with ever goes away or are we just doomed? Ive been dealing with the thought of ending since junior year of highschool, about to be a sophomore in college now, and it just doesnt seem to get any better, people said college would be better, yet here i am, even worse shape. No friends, nothing to do, nowhere to go, nobody to care about. Is there a better life after this?

selftext: My name is john dooley, im a 15 year old male from the USA. Growing up i had parents that could never admit wrong doing and always lost their cool very fast. There was always a strong family history of BPD and ADHD. I have ADHD, and a lot of BPD traits. Although i constantly have outbursts of depression and extreme outbursts of euphoria and hyperactivity. I remember my parents told me they refuse me help because they fear me being put on medications, i call bull i think they refuse me help because it damages their ego. At one point my mom told me she thinks i have schizophrenia but they always stay in the room with me when im talking to the doctor and try to move them towards diagnosing me with epilepsy even though ive had 2 normal EEG's. i believe my seizures are actually dissociation. I sometimes get a little bit paranoid and believe everyone hates me or that everyone will leave me or that im being hunted down. I even remember one time when my girlfriend didnt text back and i paniced thinking she was leaving me or that she found someone else and thats when the electrical outlet started talking to me telling me that she is evil and that my friend is wearing a mask and not to trust him. I get really scared. I thought i had BPD but that doesnt explain the manic like episodes and hallucinations.

selftext: Hello /r/NoFap !

I hope the long winded venting you are about to read is allowed on this sub.

With this post I am setting in ~~stone~~ a digital reddit post, my commitment to abstaining from PMO. I have started my streak this morning at 12:00AM (mountain time) and my logic behind making this post is that if I won’t do it for myself I will at least try to hold myself accountable and committed to the /r/NoFap community.



A little bit of background: I have been fapping since my peers introduced me to free, internet-distributed, ultra convenient pornography back in eighth grade. Since then my work ethic for school has fallen and I have become a lazy, awkward mess. As I look back on my life and my poor high school grades, I see the night I stayed up late and checked out this “porn” as the critical point that separated my albeit nerdy, but respectful and mature self from my new lazy and unmotivated self.

Over the summer of 2016, between Sophomore and Junior year, I developed what appeared to be a mouth sore on the roof of my mouth. Over the course of the summer, this sore developed into a large necrotic mass that consumed my soft palate and killed the bone of my hard palate. I saw many specialists, all left clueless by the strange symptoms and necrosis in my mouth. My grandmother died on the second week of junior year and I flew out with the rest of my immediate family to go to her funeral, while we were there Colorado Children’s Hospital back at home gave my mother a call and wanted us to come in. Within a couple months, and after undergoing a battery of tests, I was diagnosed with natural killer T-cell lymphoma (nk t-cell).

I went through four months of chemotherapy, two months of targeted radiation, surgeries to remove my palette and all the other necrotic tissue, and finally a bone marrow transplant in February 2017. It has been approximately 400 days since my transplant.

Unfortunately, I have spent many months in the hospital, immunocompromised, and isolated at home. I have watched my friends go to homecoming, prom, school sporting events. The two most fun years of high school were taken from me by this disease. I don’t have many friends, and made little contact with girls my age.

As such I spent a lot of my alone time getting the simple high of stimulating my penis through masturbation combined with pornography.

I no longer have a hard or soft palate, making my speech very difficult to understand. There is a lot of exposed bone within my head that I can touch with my tongue. I do not think that I will get a girlfriend in a long time, with the cancer-related implants and ports within my chest and a feeding tube in my stomach, in addition to not being able to speak properly. Sexual stimulation through a girlfriend will not be possible, in that way I am jealous of you capable normies.



I was unable to attend high school because of my busy medical schedule, and I dropped out soon after being diagnosed. I got my GED in February of this year and I am set to attend community college later this fall. I have started lifting and working out last week. I have started nofap this morning.

Here is to being the best self I can be through a combination of abandoning pornography and masturbation, exercising, eating well, and finding entertainment outside of computer games.

I know it is going be hard, but I’m aiming high and going to go all in.



TL;DR: Got cancer a couple years back, became isolated because no immune system, fapped a lot, trying to feel better and be a better person through not fapping with a combination of other positive changes.

Edit: Trying to fix my broken English and fixing some past/present/future tense mistakes.

selftext: Hi everyone. I've been diagnosed with ADHD I ( three years ago) and bipolar II (month or so ago) but when I go to my next psych nurse appointment I am pretty sure I'm going to talk with her about BPD because I believe that is my central issue. Of the 9 points in the DSM I think I have at least 7 of them. Though I don't cut or burn, I self harm with binge-eating I would say. And I realize that my moods are definitely mostly impacted by the people I know or come into contact with. I take criticism very hard and have had a few relationships ended very badly because of it. I also have had very volatile relationships. Much of my life has been spent feeling empty inside and I would say that my core is very unstable in terms of knowing who I am. My moods don't just seem to change on a whim for the most part or be related just to biochemistry. In fact, I'm questioning if whether what I really have on top of BPD is just SAD, or seasonal changes in mood. After talking with a friend of my husband who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, she agreed that it seemed very likely that I would fall in the category of BPD.

She also told me that psychiatrists often have had a hard time deciding even with her what her diagnosis is. She has been told she was bipolar 2 or she was BPD or somewhere in the middle. Like her, I am thinking that it would be nice to have the correct diagnosis, but the most important thing is to have meds that help and to do therapy that works. I have just started some new talk therapy, and I'm going to head in the direction of tackling the BPD side of things since I think that would be most helpful (using DBT). When I actually started to read on the bipolar boards here, I just didn't feel like I fit in very well, and I noticed that a lot of people were misdiagnosed or had a comorbid condition of BPD. Sure enough, I realized how much BPD sounded like my life story from the time I was born as a nervous, hard to soothe infant. My mother actually said that it was like my nervous system wasn't fully developed. Add to that that I was called the Ice Queen by my friends and that I have been labeled as too sensitive for much of my life by many people and it sort of all seemed to add up to me. I would likely be called The Quiet type of BPD, though, as an introvert.

Anyway, all of that to ask you how many mood shifts do you usually see in a day? That was another telltale sign for me when I started to wonder if what I was dealing with was really bipolar depression. I've been tracking my moods with a mood tracker on my phone and I noticed that I was definitely having more than one mood per day and the shifts were very noticeable, whereas most of the mood trackers that us all for other people showed more consistent moods or mood shifts every few days or even every few weeks. How many mood shifts would you say that you go through per day on an average day? On medication, I am still seeing two to three very recognizable mood shifts most days. I can feel one way one hour and then totally differently an hour later or even in less time. I am medicated at this point with Vyvanse, mood stabilizer and Propranolol for anxiety and fast pulse. These are definitely helping or I know I would have more mood swings to record. I've included my two-week chart in a comment so you can see what I mean with the moods. Thanks!!

White/British 
Height 5’4 weight 9 and a half stone
Smoker (2-5 a day)
Regular medications: 100mg pregabalin 2x/day, 100mg Tramadol as needed - I’ve taken a lot of painkillers over the years due to chronic back pain

This is long but there’s a lot of info to get down...

Last month I was in hospital for 5 days due to what was diagnosed as a kidney infection / pyelonephritis.
I had first felt the pain (my only symptom - never had an UTI or anything) 3 weeks before being admitted to hospital but had thought it was back pain as it wasn’t too severe - this was after a night out so I had been drinking the night before. Then after one alcoholic drink 3 weeks later the pain was so severe I was sent to hospital with a fever, tachycardia and blood present in urine. At hospital I was diagnosed with a left kidney infection however there was only ever any sign of infection in my blood and not in my urine, which doctors couldn’t explain.

Prescribed Trimethoprim 200mg 2x/day for a week and various painkillers, even morphine didn’t cover the pain. When the pain was at its worst it was a deep, sharp throbbing sensation that came back every other minute or so. Kept in hospital for 5 days as the fever kept coming back and I was waiting on an ultrasound, which did confirm that I had had an infection in the left kidney despite having felt pain on both sides of the inner waist during this time. Again there was no sign of UTI like stinging urine or anything, only that I was peeing more frequently than normal though this could be because I was drinking a lot of water due to dehydration (despite a saline drip). I have also never had a kidney infection or UTI before so this is new to me.

After being discharged and finishing the 7-day course of Trimethoprim I was still feeling pain on both sides and had a fever one night but this passed and doctors confirmed the infection had gone so couldn’t work out why I was still feeling pains. Prescribed Buscopan to relieve spasms but again this never covered the pain.

I have been relatively pain free until now, a month after being discharged and 1 month 3 weeks since first feeling pains at all. I have been going out for drinks twice a week though kept this to a minimum (3 pints a night) as the doctors had told me there would be no reason that alcohol should cause the pain or lead to kidney infection. Not drank since the weekend and I’m still feeling pains, though not severe at all I’m slightly worried as I move abroad in two weeks and don’t want further complications when there.

The pain is on both sides of my inner waist again and sometimes a bit higher up and round the back of my abdomen. I have a doctors appointment booked for Thursday however thought I would post on here as I never have much luck with doctors and wanted a second opinion if possible. What confuses me is that the pain was only ever brought to my attention after an alcoholic drink and that it is still present over a month later, it feels the same as it did when I was discharged from hospital so isn’t severe but it’s definitely there and I take Tramadol regularly which doesn’t even get rid of it. I am also fatigued a lot of the time and need at least 10hours sleep, though this could be linked to my chronic pain issue and has just been something I have had to deal with for years now (I am not anaemic and blood/urine tests they did they never said anything looked abnormal except the high white blood cell count that indicated infection).

If anyone has any idea of what this could be, as I know an infection in both kidneys at the same time is rare, and it seems to only have presented symptoms after a drink one night, then I would be very appreciative! Sorry this is so long!

selftext: Can anyone explain me how do schizophrenia hallucinate? How is their hallucinations different from imaginations. As I get it imagination is something which you force your conscious mind like daydream. And, hallucinations is something that comes from sub conscious deliberately. Now, If I am on a dining table and there's nothing on the plate. I imagine an apple, but does it same goes for hallucinations? Even if the person doesn't imagine it. And, hallucination mean that even if there is no apple on the plate. The person with schizophrenia sees it as there is a real apple like there's an actual apple unlike imagination. This is confusing me

selftext: I spoke to one of my friends who is a little closer to me but not quite because I didn't know who to talk to \(I live abroad for university and don't have many close friends, but many vague friends because I talk a lot in parties sometimes\). I told him that I strongly think I have ADHD and that I'm going to go home to get it assessed. He said that I was being crazy and that there was nothing wrong with me \(This guy has only ever seen me out and about and it was my mistake opening up to him, I just needed someone who was here that I could physically talk to and seek comfort from, my bad\). He told me not to get assessed because its not real and if I'm diagnosed then it will be a reality and that I should just not believe that I have ADHD because acknowledging that I do will give it the power to rule over me. He said he totally relates to all the symptoms too and he thought he had ADHD too but never got it checked because he doesn't want to give it the power and says hes doing just fine. Seems like he is able to control his tendencies if he does actually have it? He told me I am an amazing person and not to let it get to me. He said he completely understands how I feel which triggered me so I told him "I dont think you do, forget it" and now he probably thinks Im being dramatic BUT this is not about me being an amazing person, its about me needing someone to listen and try to understand what I'm going through. Hes got me all wrong, if i am diagnosed Im not going to use it as an excuse for being the way I am, remain unchanged and let it rule over me\- I want to find out for sure so I can finally understand why I behave the way I do and why I do the things I do. So I know what I should or shouldn't do to be able to live more peacefully with myself. The first step in resolving a situation is by identifying the problem innit. I've not believed I have ADHD for 20 years, but I still continuously lived like a person with ADHD. Its not something I can control, I've tried countless of ways to make myself a better person back when I didn't know I was showing strong signs of ADHD but I still always ended up behaving the same way, I just thought it was the way my personality was and I intensely bashed myself for being that way and not having the ability to change. I want to find ways to effectively work around my behaviour to make me more productive because I'm witnessing it destroy my academic and work life. I guess its hard to find someone who will try to understand, so I'm truly glad I have this space where I can speak and relate to you guys, its only been day 1 of me being on here and I already feel comforted just by knowing there are people out there that go through the same things I do.

selftext: Hey y’all I’m 23, F, diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. I mentioned to my new pcp that my old psychiatrist in passing mentioned my racing thoughts hinted at ADHD/ADD and she agreed. It was weird for me to research but I checked in a lot of boxes. She diagnosed me but wanted a second opinion but my insurance Medicaid rejected all specialists. Finally today she was like “let’s try medicine?” So I had a clear conversation taking about my needs (I’m co-morbid) and she agreed on letting me try adderall.

FINALLY. After a month I could star my journey to a better, healthier me. I was so happy. Until my insurance denied it. Now I had to talk to my doctor and hopefully she got my message to talk to my insurance but I checked on three hours later because I’m impatient and her receptionist seemed so annoyed with me and asked me to try calling them tomorrow in the afternoon if I don’t hear from them. I have trouble with patience but my biggest fear is coming across as a “drug fiend” to everyone. Anyone got trouble with public insurance approving adderall?

TLDR: My doctor prescribe adderall and my insurance denied it. I’m both sad and impatient.

selftext: Hi askdocs, I'm 30, male, weigh around 180lbs, and was diagnosed with mild hydronephrosis around 12 years ago. I haven't had any symptoms, am in pretty normal health, and fairly fit (i started running around a year ago). I have two letters regarding my hydronephrosis below and am just curious what they mean exactly. If there is no underlying cause, why would it be present? I know it says there is no need to do further work ups, but, I am trying to join the military and was wondering if there are any other tests I can get done on my kidneys as I understand the military is very strict avout letting people with hydronephrosis in.

&amp;nbsp;

History: Hydronephrosis

&amp;nbsp;

comparison: none

 &amp;nbsp;

FINDINGS: Multiple grayscale and color flow images were obtained of the kidneys and bladder.

 &amp;nbsp;

The right kidney measures 11.0 cm in long axis and the left is 11.0 cm. There is normal corticomedullary differentiation and echnogenicity. Mild left hydronephrosis. No right hydronephrosis identified. There are no renal stones seen.

 &amp;nbsp;

There is normal bilateral renal cortical perfusion.

 &amp;nbsp;

The bilateral ureteral jets are identified in the bladder. There is no significant post-void bladder residual.

 &amp;nbsp;

IMPRESSION: Mild left hydronephrosis. Otherwise negative study.

&amp;nbsp;

Another letter summarizing this states

 &amp;nbsp;

 

To whom it may concern,

&amp;nbsp;

Christopher's Hydronephrosis has been evaluated and remains unchanged over the past 9 years, there is no identifiable underlying cause and it is likely an incidental finding. He does not require any further imaging or evaluation unless symptomatic.

&amp;nbsp;

I recently did some urine testing and blood work and it all came back normal

selftext: TLDR; not sure if I have ADHD because bad reaction to medication


Last year I was diagnosed as ADHD-pi by an ADHD specialist after a written test and an hour consultation.

That being said, I can’t get over the fear that maybe I’m just a lazy person looking for an excuse

On one hand, I do have many symptoms. I always finish things in the eleventh hour, or late, and they lack polish. Unless I’m in total flow mode and then it’s great. I’ve had four jobs in the past year and they were all in different fields. I’ve had the feeling of being the ”shitshow, flaky friend” for as long as I can remember. I once racked up $300 of lost key charges in a year.

But I’ve never gotten terrible grades, I dont really space out in conversations, and I can provide for myself as a self-sufficient adult. I’ve always assumed that I’m neuro-typical, but just lazy or entitled with bouts of depression and anxiety. And my doc put me on Concerta (Ritalin) which immediately made me kind of...wired and anxious, but also spacey and unable to concentrate on anything. I stopped taking it and haven’t been back to my ADHD doc since. 

Does my bad reaction to meds mean I’m not really an ADHD person? Am I just neuro-typical but just lazy or self-centered or undisciplined?

Not that ADHD people are lazy or self-centered. I truly don’t believe that. I’m just saying, maybe I don’t have a chemical reason for not getting my life together?

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you KNOW you have it, and aren’t just lazy?

selftext: Gonna start this by saying I was addicted to xans and painkillers from 15 to 24, im 25 now been sober for a year and 3 months now. In that time i totalled 2 cars and just fcked a lot of things up that feel unfixable like not being able to work atm due to living in a large state. Being sober i still think about doing drugs every single day still and looking back i think i was intentionally trying to OD because i was suicidal when i was younger. Ive been depressed ever since i was 13 nd used drugs to cope now that im sober after all that time my depression and anxiety are worse than ever. I was diagnosed with agoraphobia about a year ago aswell. Needless to say i dont think things are going to be getting better any time soon.

I honestly havent been happy in life in over 12 years, and pretty much ive known i was gonna end it 4th of july last year. I think its sad that since then the only reason i havent done it is making shitty excuses not to do it. i just feel like im stuck in life and have no motivation to change it. The worst part of it to me is my mom finding my body. I currently have 2 ways of doing it ones a belt in a door which i dont know if it will work if it breaks ill just shoot myself in the head, i prefer the first way so its not as gory and i dont even think id struggle hanging myself how i feel atm. I think im only posting this here to make myself do it sooner than later.

selftext: I just stumbled upon this sub and figured I'd ask a few questions. I've been encouraged by a few people \(family and friends, as well as a case manager\) to apply for disability. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 9, and a panic disorder/PTSD when I was 16. I had to transfer to an alternative school my senior year of high school because I couldn't handle mainstream high school any more. I worked for a few months at a time from 18 years old to a month before my 20th birthday, but had to quit each job after a few months because I was having constant panic attacks that left me unable to function. I've been self\-employed now for almost 4 years, working from home doing surveys \(through Amazon Mechanical Turk, if anyone knows what that is. It's nowhere near minimum wage, and I'm on food stamps and in income\-based housing.

All that being said, I do have documentation, but my main problem is a consistent therapist. I live in a pretty rural area and don't drive \(courtesy of my panic disorder\). There are 2 therapy places within my area, both of which have a high turnover rate. I've been seeing therapists off and on since I was 9, but never with the same therapist for more than 8 months or so. However, most of the time I was seeing them every week or every other week. Will this spotty therapist coverage hurt me?

Another question...do I even sound like a good candidate for disability? A big part of me feels like doing so would make me a lazy mooch because technically I \*can\* work...but only for a few months at a time and my quality of life is shit. Anyone care to offer their honest thoughts on any of this?

selftext: So, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and with BPD, at separate times. I have been on medication off and on, however, currently I am not taking any meds. I mostly drink kava and kratom, and I smoke weed now. Recently, I have been obsessing over whether or not I even know who I am. Where do I stop and where does the mood and/or personality disorder begin? Can a distinction even be made? For instance, I love body modifications so I have many tattoos and a few piercings. Yesterday, I went ahead and randomly got dimple piercings and an under chin tattoo. I almost immediately started to think: am I manic or would I have gotten these done either way? I had an identity crisis. I began to doubt myself and my decisions. It did not help that my boyfriend was not very receptive of the changes. Needless to say, today I removed the piercings and I now want to get the new tattoo, along with a few older ones, removed. I have been a mess all day, though. I am having an existential crisis as well. I feel like I am returning to school to become something that I don’t even care to be. I feel like I am only trying to please my family in that regard. Lately, I have been feeling like such a failure and disappointment to them. I also do not find myself having true friends and this only exacerbates my negative feelings. I am reconsidering my career path once again. Sometimes I just feel like running away and moving to a new place. I know I should not run away from my problems but I feel like I need a fresh start in a place where nobody knows me. Anyway, just venting I guess. Thanks.

selftext: Let me preface this by saying I wasn't diagnosed with Aspergers until I was an adult even though it has always been there looking at my past medical history if any of the many therapists I saw had just looked. Now onto my rant: 

I am a 32 year old Male who has been unemployed since 2009 when I was fired from my job for something I didn't even do (another story that rankles almost as much as what I'm about to relate does but I digress) I have had a hard time finding work since and since I live with my parents who are both disabled my mother thought it would be a good idea for me to apply for disability due to my diagnosis. I have been denied multiple times even with 300 pages of mental health issues in my medical records and at this point I am ready to give up. The last time I appealed the judge told me in open court I wasn't autistic I was just lazy. Now my only options are to drop the case (what I want to do) or file a civil suit (what my mother wants to do) I am tired of not being believed. I am tired of no one listening. I am tired of just existing af this point. I can't be around other people (and that includes my parents) for an extended period of time or else I have a meltdown. 

I don't even know why I posted this really. Maybe just to vent. Maybe just to feel like someone will listen. I don't really know. I don't know if I'm going to get reamed for this post (tbh I kind of expect to) but I'm going to post it anyways just to get it off my chest.

selftext: I was diagnosed in 3rd grade (junior year of high school now) with ADHD inattentive type. In middle school, I was in a special class for kids who had ADHD. The teachers were super helpful and I feel like I benefitted from the class, but when they talked about the symptoms, it was ways academically focused, and basically emphasized impulse control, which I didnt have many problems with. After looking through some other posts on ADHD, I see that a lot of people have other symptoms. Like prone to over/under stimulation, hyper-fixations, heightened sensitivity to rejection, etc. I always thought these were just personality traits, not related to my ADHD!

I feel like despite having this diagnosis for over a decade with multiple confirmations recently, and being lucky enough to be in a supportive school program, I know very little about ADHD. I think I've been in denial, and been making an effort to not fall in to a self pitying cycle. I dont think I would use my ADHD as a crutch, but I didnt want to give myself the opportunity. I can keep up in school when I'm medicated.

I have lots of questions now, specifically about my medicine. Has anyone else experienced hypersensitivity to loud sounds/bright lights/weird textures while on medication? I'm on a generic for concerta, and dont have any issue with sensory overload when I'm not on my medication. 

Do you find any relief from stim toys? I really want something to chew on, but I'm not sure if it will even help. 

Have you found any weird tips that have really helped? 

Thank you guys so much, reading through some of the posts on this subreddit have been incredibly helpful.

I know that no one on the internet is a substitute for a doctor, and I have not visited the doctor for 6 years or more, but I was just wondering if anyone experienced symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, mild nausea, mild agoraphobia, and mild aches and pains, this late into the game? I didn't experience much of anything in the way of withdrawal symptoms the first few days. 

I realize now I really should see a doctor. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease 8 years ago, but the symptoms completely went away within a few weeks, and I carried on as if I'd never received the diagnosis, like it wasn't real. Maybe I drank to cover it up. But either way, I never got super sick or required any medical treatment in the 8 years since. I'm very worried now that I have the alcohol stripped away, that maybe I've done something to irreversibly injure my body. I was drinking heavily, to the point of black out on occasion, in recent years. Near the end, I was also taking benzodiazepines and sometimes (rarely) codeine/acetaminophen tablets with a lot of alcohol. I can only imagine the damage this might have done. I'm so scared right now. I know, once again, that no one can give me medical advice. Just had nowhere else to put my anxieties. I know I have to face up to reality now that I'm sober and see a doctor. 

That said, if anyone has heard of any experience of feeling mildly physically unwell around the 10 day mark, let me know.

selftext: Hello all! I'm hoping for some input and advice. I just got hired to work at a major high end fashion retailer in WA in the alterations department as an apprentice. The job sounds great except for one little thing: our company does not allow us to listen to music or use headphones. I know I'm much more focused and efficient when I can work while listening to music, podcasts or NPR. I'm also easily distracted by machine sounds (constantly trying to troubleshoot by the sound. Sewing machines, like engines, have a wide variety of sounds that indicate malease) the alterations shop doesn't play music and the other tailors work pretty silently. 
I'm worried about how well I'll be able to work without the crutch of music. I'm currently on 30mg of Vyvanse every morning. I'm not sure if this dosage is right. I'm hoping that I'll surprise myself and I'll be able to work better than expected. I haven't been diagnosed that long since my family didn't believe in ADHD and just thought I was sloppy and lazy. Vyvanse is my second prescription, the first started with "met" and was extended release.  


Does anyone have any advice for me? My first day is on Tuesday. Should I try to up my dose of Vyvanse or switch meds? Ask HR for accommodation? I didn't claim any disability on my application. I assume the restriction is for safety so I doubt I can ask to wear ear plugs. My friends in other shops for different companies are allowed to use headphones.

TLDR; new job in tailor shop where I can't listen to music and I'm easily distracted by mechanical sounds. What should I do?

selftext: Im 18, dont smoke, no medications, I live in Canada and I am somewhat active; 125 lbs, 6ft tall

Recently I have noticed I have been ejaculating less; I went to the doctor a few weeks ago and was diagnosed with epididymitis. I suspect there is more or something else such as a blockage in one of the tubes my semen travels through when I ejaculate.

I took antibiotics and it kind of helped my epididymitis, but I dont think it was 100% cured.

Fast forward to now, and ever since I got epididymitis, I have had a lot less semen when I ejaculate

I am getting an ultrasound on Friday as I went to the doctor a few days ago. Had a urine and blood test as well.

Im sexually active (with myself LOL) and I used to ejaculate a LOT; it seems to have gone down drastically, and I mentioned that to my doctor

He suspected one of three things: a hurnea, epididymitis, or groin pull (had pain in groin were my leg and hip meet, near pubic area which radiated to my testicle)

I also noticed that sometimes when I ejaculate, I have a sort of gel-like matter in my semen; it is almost like a booger-ish texture (best I could describe)

Every once in a while I can ejaculate a lot, but it mostly comes out as clear liquid along with that weird clump of what I think is sperm (happened 2x now)

If anyone has an idea of what the cause may be, please let me know as I really want to have children one day and I dont want to become infertile!

selftext: for a long ass fucking time, i've been suffering from symptoms of dissociation identity disorder. combined with severe social anxiety, it's impossible for me to put into words exactly the way i feel. and for that reason, i haven't been diagnosed with anything, so people won't ever take me seriously when i talk about how much i want to kill myself. i'm shit broke and my family doesn't give a fuck so i can't even see a doctor about it.

i think too much. i dream too much. i care too much. from the outside, i'm the most generic 2009 9gag ass black hoodie nerd loser ever, and inside, i don't even know what the fuck is going on. i can't articulate my feelings properly and inherently people don't give a fuck when i try to explain myself.

also, my body is disproportionate and my face is repulsive. my ethnicity is fucking weird, so weird i'm not even gonna try to get into it, but i'm mixed as shit. i look like the genetic product of osama bin laden having ten hours of non stop anal sex with eric trump. my skin color leans more towards black, and i'm not going to act like it doesn't affect me. it alone doesn't bother me but the fact that i get shit from for both white people stuff i do and black people stuff i do shows how fucking unlucky i am.

also i'm gay and that contributes to the reasons why my family doesn't give a shit about me. so you can guess what kind of environment i was raised in.

update. i was planning to write more but this isn't a call for help anymore. this is just a farewell.

selftext: I've been having issues with my mother lately. It's been like this ever since I had to leave college early due to illness. She barely ever talks to me because she thinks I'm too negative and gloomy. Granted, I'm not the most positive person in the world. But when you if you were like me and you had to deal with being diagnosed with cancer at 18 and having to tack on two extra years of undergrad because of pneumonia, you'd be pissed off too. We also had an argument while we were out driving. I'm currently 22 and don't have my driver's license but have been taking private lessons. I wasn't doing too well, not looking both ways at a stop sign and she got angry. During the argument, I told her I wanted to get my license to make her happy. She tells me she doesn't care if I get my license and she only told me to get it when I was 16 because "that's what normal people do". As if I haven't been dealing with being sick and going to college full time. Yes, I should have gotten it earlier, but who the fuck says that kind of shit to their kid? 

I remember the day of my fifth grade graduation. My mom didn't show up. When I came home, she said she didn't show up because she was embarrassed of me because I got in trouble a lot during the fifth grade. Ever since then, all I've tried to do was make her proud of me. Whatever people thought of me didn't matter as long as I was doing good in her eyes. But as she's becoming more and more distant to me, it makes me feel like I don't matter to her anymore. Like I'm simply a burden she's better off without. How should I try to make amends?

selftext: TL;DR: I want to learn basic life skills. I don't even know where to start. Just stuff like how to organize my things, and how to fix financial problems and manage money. 

I was diagnosed as an adult at 21. I'm almost 22 now, and this has been a tough year. I lived in a dormitory type environment for 3 years at my first two jobs. Now I'm more or less on my own in the "real world"
My time working for the government was great, they fed me, they gave me a place to stay as long as I kept it clean and showed up for roll call in the morning. I loved the structured life, but I really need to grow up. I'm struggling with regular life.

I have bills piling up, collectors calling me, all that real life shit that I should really get on top of. Not just financial either, like how do I organize things in general? When I was a kid and my mom would ask me to clean my room, I would just throw all my things under the bed and that was that. To be honest, that last line really sums up a good portion of my life so far. 

I want to learn how to organize things in my home, how to recognize problems before they snowball, how to structure my life. I feel like a child asking these kinds of questions, it doesn't seem like an acceptable thingfor an adult to ask. 

But yeah, anyways, how do normal people go about existing? I wish that there were some Neurotypical people here to give some insight on to what their thought process and experiences are like.

Sex: Male

Height: 6" 4'

Weight: 167Kg

Race: Caucasian 

Duration of complaint: 10 years, acute pains occur for 4 hours. 

Location: UK

Smoking: Never

Drinking: Socially but not often

Diet: History of poor processed diet due to depression, currently balanced.  

Existing medications: None. I recently stopped using sertraline as no effects were identified. 

Relevant medical diagnosis: I have been put under the blanket term of irritable bowel syndrome. I have diarrhea very often with occasional constipation. I have been diagnosed with strong anxiety. 


Description:

I occasionally get a strong acute cramping pain in the abdominals, radiating out around the belly, also radiating to the back without affecting my sides, and down to the left side of the groin including the left vas deferens, penis and testis. Headaches often follow but may simply be a result of the pain. After an hour it begins to spread under the left pectoral muscle. 

In the past they usually occurred right before exams and meditation would sometimes help leading me to believe it was from extreme stress. 

Exams have now ended and I am still getting them on a near weekly basis, not only this but the pain is beginning to spread immediately up to under my left and now right pectoral in Y shape.  There is no obvious cause or trigger for the events anymore. Recently I was watching tv, one began and I couldn't move from the sofa due to the pain. I am also finding meditation no-longer helps, perhaps stress was one of but not the only trigger. 

As usual the NHS had been of little help. I've been on a waiting list for 7 years and the most they've done is prescribe paracetamol and codine.

Can someone suggest a cause and/or treatment/preventative.

selftext: I've been living with this for about 4 years. I was diagnosed with depression and a bit of other mental illnesses. I was doing really good there for a while. But I always had relapses. It gets a little worse each time. I can't help thinking this all could've been avoided had I died the first time I attempted. 

I can't even escape in my sleep. Having PTSD means I get nightmares. 10/10. just what I need /s 

I just get so frustrated because I don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I'm fucking tired of panic attacks. I'm fucking tired of having to push myself just to go to class. I wish it was something I could take a pill to go away. But I can't. It's something I need to work on constantly. Maybe I don't want to work on it. Then I start doubting my desire to get better. Maybe I do deserve it because I have no energy to get up and get help. Why bother asking for help if I'm not willing to help myself. I have zero reason to be like this. Nothing significant happened recently to trigger this. My brain just woke up one day and decided you know what we haven't had in while? A depressive episode. 


I feel bad for my family because up until this point they've been trying their best to help me. I have horrible episodes and they get worried because they know my history with self harm and suicide attempts. I don't want to reach out to friends either because they aren't equipped to deal with my depressed ass. They want to help but it's not fair on them and it's not like they can either. Sorry this got rambly. I wish I could just hurry up and die lol. I'm exhausted

selftext: Hi everyone!

I'm new to the sub and actually just new to Reddit as a whole! This is my first post!

I'm currently in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD, but started medication for my anxiety about a month ago. Since I started my medication, I noticed that those who knew I was on it started to treat me differently. It's almost as if they started being nicer and more tolerant towards me when they found out I was taking my medication.

About two weeks in, I forgot to take my pills and skipped a day. Of course, being on a new medication changes the way you act, but I know that skipping that one day didn't affect how the medication had helped me within this time. Well, on this particular day I got irritated while driving and my moms first reaction was to ask me if I had taken my medication. I told her that I forgot to take it the night before, but will continue later that day. She then went on to tell me how I was brash and "on edge" and that I NEED the medication so that I can be calm and productive.

I don't know how to describe it, but I felt shameful. Because, she implied that any reaction from me that isn't calm and collective will be met with concern of me not being on my medication, rather than actually listening to what has upset me subjectively.

Has this happened to you? How do you deal with it?
It makes me feel like I want to tell everyone I'm not taking my medication anymore, but just take it low key without telling anyone.

I hope I've articulated myself well, and that I haven't written too much.

Thank you.

selftext: Hello Everyone,
I guess the title says it all. I have OCD, and severe depression. I was diagnosed with both over 10 years ago, at 14 years old, and am fortunate enough to have found a balance between medication and therapy that keeps me functional most days. 

But, as I'm sure I don't have to tell any of you, the two illnesses tend to feed off each other. My OCD centers around obsessing over past failures and performing rituals to soothe my fear of failing again in the future. I also struggle with harm OCD and obsess over whether or not I'm a negative, harmful influence on the lives of those around me or that I'll eventually literally harm someone.

And on the days when my OCD acts up, and my brain tells me I'm worthless and I'm going to fail and I'm going to drag down everyone I love with me, that triggers my depression. On these (thankfully) rare, bad days, I lose the motivation to do anything, even follow through with my compulsions. I can't get out of bed. Then later I realize that I wasted an entire day, missed work, and didn't do anything productive or helpful. Which is a failure, which triggers the OCD, which triggers the depression...and so on and so forth...it's a cycle that can lead to a few really bad days.

I have a very understanding workplace, but even still, I'm worried that these cycles will start to negatively affect my career, or at the very least will lower my coworkers' opinions of me.

So, on the days when the OCD, depression and/or other mental illnesses hit with a vengeance, how do you all find the motivation to get out of bed, go to work, and go on with a normal day?

selftext: Like the title says, yesterday I connected with my father and 2 half sisters for the first time in my life (I'm 38). I was so nervous but it went really well and I'm genuinely really happy for the first time in months. My brother (from my mom) died about a week before this last Christmas very unexpectedly from epilepsy at 29 yrs and at the time I was already being treated for depression and anxiety disorder. It's been about 6 months of some really intense grief and sadness but it's starting to get easier and I began reflecting on what I wanted for my own life after seeing just how short and unpredictable it can be. I decided that I needed to stop letting my fear of rejection get in the way of making an attempt at getting to know my half sisters. 

My sisters told me that my father has bipolar disorder and 1 of my sisters has depression and anxiety. My mother has bipolar disorder, too, so I wasn't surprised to have been diagnosed with depression myself, but to learn that my father's has mood disorder issues too is oddly comforting. Not because I want them to also suffer, that's not it! But because it helped me feel for the first time that I'm really not to blame for my depression or anxiety, despite everything I've read on the topic that already told me this, I feel like I'm really actually believing it for once. 

If you've read this far, thank you, and know that you're not at fault for your depression. Even if your depression isn't written into your genes, it's truly a medical condition regardless of how you ended up with it. Be kind to yourselves out there. &lt;3

selftext: Hi friends. \&lt;3  


I've been having a hell of a time these past several days. I had an episode building last week that blew out of the water Friday, and since then I've had \(gradually decreasing\) constantly present anxiety and physical agitation, which has made things hard at work.  


However, there's more going on than just that. I can't concentrate if I just have work. I have to have music, or Netflix, or Reddit going on at the same time as I do my work, just something to keep my brain going, while I work. And I've let work pile up for...days and sometimes weeks, stuff that needs to get done but isn't. It doesn't help matters that we are understaffed \(fact\) and overworked \(fact\), but I had a coworker talk to me about it today to the effect of "we've had this conversation a few times now and I don't want to go to our manager with it, but if it continues I will".

SO. I don't fucking know. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, incorrectly I believe, and given Vyvanse 70mg. And welbutrin. Which caused a psychotic manic episode. Yay me! So I'm extremely leery about trying adhd meds. 

But I've noticed the same "need two things at once" is pretty consistent, though there are times when I'm able to focus on things, AND certain management strategies for adhd have helped me focus in the past when I just...couldn't.

I think I have enough of a reason right now to talk to my psychiatrist, with everything I just wrote. \(Good job me, talking myself into this. LOL\) But my question is, what led to your comorbid diagnosis? Whatever's going on is really fucking with my work, and I need to get on top of it.

selftext: I was diagnosed with depression in November of 2017. I know that I have been dealing with it since 2006. Since then I have gotten help and medication and I am better. I have made no attempts on taking own my life but have come close and I think about it almost every day. I work a lot at a few different jobs and even though I don't work out, I am on my feet and on the go a lot. I teach music in the Nashville area and I know that even though I don't get paid enough to live with just teaching, it's what I enjoy most and I'll work whatever other jobs I have to to be able to teach.

That being said, I get this terrible feeling almost every week. I feel like there isn't anything I've thing that I would really dive so deep that I could become an expert and do great things. I do love teaching music but I when I have down time I don't want to study theory or practice my own music or write something or anything like that. I also really like cooking but I don't find myself ever really wanting to cook.

There are plenty of other things that I feel the same way about.

My question to you all is what can I do? I went from "Wanting to die every day" to "Wanting to die every day but making an effort to find a reason to stay". How do I make it to "Wanting to make an effort towards something at least enough to forget that I still want to die every day"?

Thank you for your time

TL;DR How do you find meaning in singing enough to want to be better at that something?

selftext: I haven't been diagnosed with OCD, but based on some posts I've seen, it sounds like I have contamination OCD (I'm not sure if this is different than germaphobia). It primarily revolves around washing after using the restroom. I think it stems from not knowing what is clean, or at least clean enough. 

I was taught to wash my hands after using the restroom, which I think is a generally accepted good, sanitary practice. I'm not entirely sure what the source of the germs is that necessitates washing my hands. I'm assuming it would primarily come from excreting urine and feces, so I generally consider my whole pelvic region as dirty. Also, I consider anything it touches as dirty, which also propagates that dirtiness. For example, the dirtiness of my pelvis gets transferred to my underwear, which transfers to my legs if I pull my pants down to sit on a toilet, so I can't even touch my legs without feeling the need to wash my hands.

I realize that this is extreme, but I'm not sure how to fix it. I'm not hyper-sanitary in a lot of other areas. I just thought about this area and became paranoid about it. I'm not even specifically worried about anything other than maybe being slightly more prone to get sick. I just don't want to be "dirty". 

I want to be less paranoid about this, but I don't want to go too far and try to drag myself to ditch all hygiene until I'm ok with being filthy. For those of you that deal with or have dealt with something similar, how did you handle it? What has helped you overcome it?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.

selftext: I was diagnosed and prescribed Ritalin about 6 weeks ago. Since starting it I’ve gone up each week from 10mg a day to 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 to 60 week by week (as per doctor’s instructions)

I felt no difference when I started or any of the times I increased the dosage I even stopped taking it for a 5 days and then took a high dose (30mg in the morning) to get a better idea of whether it actually did anything. Still no difference, except slightly more anxiety and sweating. The focus benefit is almost imperceptible if any and it doesn’t help with my constant daydreams at all. 

I’m worried because I’m in the UK and we only have Ritalin, concerta and Elvanse (vyvanse) but an instant release one is much better for my erratic schedule. 

Has anyone else had this problem with Ritalin or any other meds and then found it start working at some point? I’ve heard some people have a build up effect so it doesn’t work straight away but I’m not sure if that’s true. 

I’m seeing a private doctor and I asked about dexamphetamine, since I’ve heard of people taking that in the UK. He seemed to not have heard of it and just said he’ll check whether he can prescribe it. 

Can anyone give me info about what the dexamphetamine situation is in London or England? I’m confused and my doctor doesn’t know. 

Other than that I’d be grateful to hear any similar experiences with Ritalin or other meds not working at first. Whether you changed meds  or waited, how big was the difference when they started working? 

Very grateful for any advice. I had such high hopes!

selftext: I had an experience yesterday that's really thrown me for a loop, that being said, I'm going to give some backstory. 

The night started with my friend and I going to UGA's music school trying to write some songs. 
We were on the 5th floor since the pianos there are better, so we had to take an elevator up. The night went fairly basic, we came up with some good stuff but it was a little mind numbing sitting in a solid white padded (soundproof) room for 4+ hours. Anyways, as we proceeded to leave at around 11PM we started to head down the long hallway to the elevator. Now, said hallway is very bright, and white, and has large full size windows at each end, and given the contrast in light from the inside to outside, the windows were acting as if they were just simply mirrors. 

Now this is where shit has hit me pretty hard:

As we came up to the window walking side by side, I just glanced up and saw our reflection in a certain way. Immediately I felt this wave of the most intense Deja Vu I'd ever experienced followed by some of the most sincere, gut wrenching panic and fear I've felt in my life.
The feeling of paranoia has stuck with me since this happened and I cant shake the feeling something bad is going to happen even though I know everything is fine and it's all in my head...

What the hell happened to me?

I'm Male/19/5,8/165lbs.  Used to smoke but stopped, no medication, and no prior medical conditions. (Besides possibly depression but I was not diagnosed so I'm not going to claim that's what it is at the moment.)

selftext: Male,  5'10"  180lbs,  non smoker,  have been diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder on the DSM IV... Autism Spectrum on the DSM V. Also diagnosed prominently with Anxiety.. depression, ADHD, and OCD. \(ADHD since 1'st grade, the rest have mostly accumulated when I turned 18\) I live in downtown Pittsburgh, PA. A bad neighborhood.. and I'm currently prescribed with 20mg of Paxil.

I've been taking the 20mg of Paxil for a few weeks now and I'm unable to achieve an orgasm anymore and also I'm extremely fatigued.. like downright exhausted during the day, no loss of sleep.

Other than those side effects, the Paxil has been a **little** helpful. But when **any** situation occurs where I feel unsafe or uncomfortable\- the medicine seems to completely lose it's helpfulness. 

This leads me to believe than Benzo's would be better suited for me. Such as Xanax, Valium, or Klonopin. I asked my Doctor about putting me on Xanax during our very first meeting, but she was completely opposed to the idea, because of the addictiveness. I also think she wanted to kill two or three birds with one stone, as in the depression and OCD that I've heard Paxil is also supposed to help.

\* Also, I was inspired to post this tonight because I was experiencing major tooth pain and took a Hydrocodone pill that I was previously prescribed.

I feel this is important to mention, because for the first time in many months, I felt happy, relaxed, motivated, and calm. I felt cured.

I've been on many SSRI's and none of them have seemed to help: Celexa, Prozac, Zoloft, I believe Lexapro as well. Also Strattera as a supplement. \*

\*\* I have also done some research and I'm aware that combining a Pain\-killer and a Benzo is dangerous and I would never make the mistake of combining the two. The Opioid I took tonight was a very rare circumstance\- as I \(was\) feeling immense pain \*\*

Any advice, suggestions, or feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Yeah I get that you don't want to up my Adderall at our first meeting (even though I sorely need it &amp; you work with my therapist), but maybe asking someone to look into the past isn't such a great idea? 

I've been purposefully avoiding it b/c once I got diagnosed &amp; put on Adderall I discovered that lovely thing called executive functioning and I *did* have some brief moments of "well just wtf could I have done if my brain had been functioning properly???

As if telling them that my life is better now &amp; the differences pre- &amp; post-diagnosis aren't enough.

Is it because I was diagnosed as an adult? Or because I'm a woman? Because I know those are both things people have issues with. And I had to leave my old pdoc b/c even though he's the one who started me on Adderall he made me feel like I was an addict asking for drugs not *medication.* (tip: if you're not comfortable prescribing something DON'T). *sigh*

So hive mind: do you have any advice? Idk this is rambly, but I had to step away b/c it's also painful to make this forking list.

tl;dr: Pretty much the title, tbh. Looking into my past is something I avoid b/c I used to not have regrets &amp; if I think about it too much I'll realize that my undiagnosed ADHD could have contributed to a lot of things I tried &amp; crashed &amp; burned on. And now I'm mad.

selftext: I've had depression my whole life (since I was 10 or so). it's been so long, I dont even know who or what I am without it. I've never been "happy" so far as I can tell. when I am feeling happy, I instantly start thinking about all of the negative things in my life and my depression comes back.
over the last 9 months, I've begun to seriously dislike my job (been there for almost 2 years). some times the things my supervisors say are completely wrong and when I give them feedback I get reprimanded. but even more recently, my mom was diagnosed with ALS and my uncle with stage 4 cancer (just passed yesterday) and work was treating my "better."

so now I can't tell if I actually hate my job or my depression just wants to ruin a good thing.

selftext: Hi all. This is my first time posting here so sorry if I mess up a bit. 

I have not fully been diagnosed with BPD but I have been told that I have many BPD characteristics. One of those that I've noticed is that I always have a favorite person.

Currently, my FP is out of town for work. They won't be back until Sunday. All of the sudden I find myself extremely depressed and not knowing what to do with myself. I've been in the situation before and I don't like it. Luckily my FP understands everything and it doesn't bother them if I tell them that I miss them a lot or so on. 

If anyone has advice on how to deal with the depression or not be so reliant on FP, I would greatly appreciate it. I don't want to be dependent on another person for my happiness and put that burden on them (which I'm sure we all feel).

selftext: Hi all. So back in January I got fired from my job. I’ve since been diagnosed and realized I’ve got pretty severe ADD (along with major depression and anxiety), and wasn’t medicated. I couldn’t keep up, couldn’t understand my job, couldn’t get organized, made a mess of things, and was fired. Now I need to find another job, but I have no idea how to explain my firing. I want to say that I had an untreated mental illness, have sought treatment, and am now on medication, but I’m not sure about talking about mental illness with potential employers. But if I don’t then it basically looks like I got fired for being too stupid and lazy to do my job. Not a great look.  
  
Has this happened to anyone? How have you handled it? Any advice would be so appreciated. Thanks.

selftext: My wife and I have been together for almost five years and married four of them. We have a wonderful 2 year old and with that, lots of joy but a year ago this April, she cheated on me “out of spite”. Now, when we first got together she did mention being diagnosed with bi-polar but nothing was done about it (her mom just disregarded it).  It’s been a very hard road and I’m trying to find some mental stability with all of this. Where do I begin? How? I’m drawing blanks and finding myself more fed up than upset most days. Truthfully, I do love her but, we’ve had a lot of fights and the infidelity that could or couldn’t be from the bi-polar is kicking my ass. It’s hard to forgive and move on. It’s like fighting a mountain from underground.

And it's scary now because it's out and because I can't handle it. I don't know why I'm upset I have no reason to be. Even the worst outcome is not that bad.  Failure is not that bad, but I'm still terrified and  anxious. I hate waking up, I don't want to exist. My reprieve is two hours after the gym when things feel okay. Is this how I'm supposed to feel all the time? Is this how others are? 

I haven't actually been diagnosed, I don't like seeing doctors here, I might just be bullshitting myself, maybe I'm making a big deal out of nothing. I just feel so tired of not being okay.

Up until recently I believed that the Mental Health Field was a bunch of Hocus Pocus and that I am who I am, so I never bothered getting checked. I’m 23 now, and both of my siblings recently were diagnosed with ADHD and are doing a lot better now, so I figured this is something that I should really look into. My first psychiatrist appointment is for next Wednesday. It’s just really frustrating having to go a whole week knowing the (probable) reason why I can’t focus at work, but not being able to do much about it for now. I really hope I’m able to get set up on meds (if that’s what I need) on my first visit so that I can begin to focus on my work and not get in trouble anymore.

I started to feel the sensation of having to pee like my urethra was irritated but nothing was coming out. By Thursday I had had an irritating, burning sensation that I had to pee all day but minimal amounts of urine came out each time. It cannot be and STD because I am a virgin still and am 15. It is better as of today (Friday) but still having this feeling . Since it started I have quit masturbation and plan to completely after this but am scared this is irreversible damage and don’t know if I should see a doctor and I can’t find anything to diagnose this as.

selftext: I've only recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and am just starting to learn about what my moods mean. For years I thought I was just a bad person \- lied, stole, cheated, hurt people's feelings \- because I never felt bad about what I did, until one little thing kicked me off and all of a sudden everything I'd done in my disinhibited state came crashing down on me. I now know that these are my highs and lows and that with time my meds will help me control them, but that doesn't help the emotional pain I'm feeling at the thought of doing all these horrible things just because I could and they made me feel great about myself, that I could get away with all that.

Is/was anyone in a situation like mine? How did you deal with it? Can you give me any sort of advice on how to prevent acting like that when I'm in a mania?

selftext: 24 Male, 55kg and I have been having pain in the right side (on and off) for more than a month. 

The first time had an sudden onset when I woke up one day. I have had pain of this type (but not recurrent) like once a year, every year or so. Went to a doctor during early teens for this he sent me home and said there was nothing to worry about.

I did not look at my testicles to see if it was twisted or not.

The pain was VERY SHARP and went up till lower abdomen. I couldn't move so I wore tight underwear and the pain decreased in intensity the next day. Pain came back 3-4 days later so I went to a doctor on the second day of pain and had an ultrasound (on the 3rd day) which turned out to be normal (normal flow, no varicoceles etc.). 

On a later appointment (on 6th day of pain) doctor saw the ultrasound result, did a physical inspection to conclude that Epididymis is very tender and diagnosed Epididymitis (even though not sexually active, no pain w/ urination, no swelling, no discharge, no fever) and prescribed antibiotics. I also got an appointment with urologist for 2 weeks later.

Pain went away before I started antibiotics but I kept taking them. Over the course of two weeks I had 2-3 more occurrences of the pain. The pain starts when I go out/drive a car etc. (I work from home) and slowly wanes away after 2-3 days. Still clear urine, no swelling, fever or any other symptom other than scrotal pain.

During my urologist appointment I was diagnosed with Intermittent testicular torsion on the basis of my story and physical inspection. He suggested a surgery but couldn't perform one himself so I had to get an appointment with another urologist.

The second urologist just seemed to agree with the medical records of the first urologist.

All three times during physical exam it turned out that my Epididymis is tender and painful. Other than that there are no symptoms. 

This is what my scrotum looks like:

selftext: I honestly fear for my well being, I am so scared of how all this will end up. I have been getting worse week after week, and month after month since last fall. Everyday is constant depression, anxiety so bad it borders on paranoia, I get intrusive thoughts, my thoughts race so badly and I get obsessions that consume all of my time and energy. My moods swing. I feel like I am going to go crazy or lose my sanity. I spend too much time alone in my room and in my house. I can't function at all. I am like this whether I'm around people or by myself. It feels like I have no control over anything, that I cannot alter or change anything about my situation. I drink sometimes to escape. I feel abandoned, isolated, like no one wants anything to do with me, like people have something against me. I hide from the world. 

I was diagnosed recently with bi polar disorder among other diagnoses that I already have. I'm in therapy with a new therapist, but it has not been helping yet, and the medications I am on are not doing anything for my symptoms. I want to find a new dr as I am really unhappy with my current one and how he treats me. He even mentioned that I see a new dr because we were not on the same page about the medications. And his answer to everything is "admit yourself" "go inpatient" which I did back in February and it did nothing but put me on medications that made me worse and they had to be changed. 

I feel I failed as a human being, I failed myself for not finding happiness, for not being where I want to be or how I'd like to be. I failed as a son too. I feel guilty that my mom is unwell because I am unwell. She worries about me a lot and doesn't know how to help me which makes her feel frustrated, helpless, and does not know what to do, I feel bad about that, I feel bad that we argue. I wish my mom was happy with me and proud of me. I feel I failed my family and friends too. I wish I had a healthier stable relationship with them and I could help them out and do some good in everyone's lives. I just feel completely useless as a person, and worthless. I only keep going to not hurt my mother and because I am too scared to act out on urges to hurt myself or attempt suicide. 

I cannot sustain this, I cannot go on like this, I don't know what to do. I am scared of the future, of staying like this or getting worse, because if it does, than how will I end up??

selftext: My name is Mike, and I own a decently sized video game studio. I have schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder, depression, anxiety, adhd, bipolarity, insomnia, and short term memory loss. I want to make the next game for my studio about schizophrenia. I think the main character should start out without schizophrenia and slowly have it build, so that the first few hallucinations you have you think are real, but then you slowly realize that they arent. I want there to be hallucinations as a sort of augmented reality AND completely encapsulated hallucinations in which nothing at all is real. The goal is to make the player question what is and isnt real in the same way we do. I want this game to teach people about our struggles. I want to make this plot interesting with many twists, but am not sure where to start. I think two other characters should have schizophrenia, the antagonist and the protagonists right hand person. Does anyone have ideas for a story structure? How should the schizophrenic characters interact with each other and other characters, as well as the rest of the world? Keep in mind i want this to be as accurate a depiction as possible, so certain things (like hallucinating a wall that keeps you from moving forward until you unlock something) would be out of the question. Where can I find resources to build this kind of plot? What character archetypes should be involved? I think it should be set in the future. How could futuristic technology affect this story? What would make a story like this appeal to you the most? What about this story could best show people without schizophrenia what its like? What gameplay mechanics would fit well in this context? What would like to see in it specifically?

Obviously I'm not wishing this illness on anyone, but I'd like to have more people to look up to besides John Nash and Elyn Saks. Does anyone else feel this way about this recent trend of coming out, like the jealous feeling that you wish someone with schizophrenia would come out?

So appariently my psych doctor thinks I have bipolar disorder type 2 which confuses me because I'm already diagnosed with borderline. And I can't stop wondering if only one of them is right or if I could have both or if one just looks a lot like the other?

Because my moods used to look so much like borderline, fast changing and not lasting very long. Of course I've had few depressive moods since I was 13 that lasted longer but the majority looked like BPD. 
But as I got older all those moods just got longer and longer and then I started having these "ups" that looks a lot like hypomania. And now my moods look more like bipolar.
I'm so confused and a part of me somehow feels like I'm faking everything. Like I looked at bipolar and somehow starting "copying it" and believing I had it. But at the same time I always think "what the fuck how do my body decide I only need 3 hours of sleep" etc. But I don't even know if I believe I am bipolar.
Like I'm not even sure I'm gonna end up diagnosed with it and I feel both are similar enough that I don't even know what I personally think anymore

Honestly I don't even know
Does anyone else have experience with this?
I mean with being confused about if you have bpd or bipolar etc

selftext: I am 17 years old, and I graduate High School May 25th. There are several things I need advice on, and need to vent about as well. 

**#1** **-** One thing I really need advice on, is that I am addicted to soda, I have anywhere from 2-3 16oz bottles a day. I wake up every morning and drive to school, and I buy a bottle of soda for $1.50. If I do not drink soda in the mornings, I get a really bad headache until I have a soda or caffeine.

**tl;dr** **#1** **-** 
I don't know what to drink instead of soda in the mornings. 
I don't like coffee that well, and I hate any kind of tea. I thought about water, but its early, and I will still have a headache after.

**#2** **-** I really need money, any little bit helps now. I need to buy my own food now at times, and I need gas money and other stuff. I have such bad anxiety and stress (will talk about that in a minute), that I can't get a job until college, even then, I don't know how I am going to do it... 

**tl;dr** **#2** **-** I need a way to make money online or something, I live in an extremely rural area, with no "cities" within driving distance that wouldn't take an hour after school to travel to one way, so I can't get a physical job yet. What can I do online to earn some extra money? Even if it is $10 a week, that would be helpful.

**#3** **-**Third, and final (for now, I could go on all day...), is my stress and mostly my anxiety.. I can't seek "professional" help until I am in college this fall. I am not diagnosed or anything, but I know I have it.. What are some tips for anxiety and panic attacks? The main causes of my anxiety is being scared something bad is going to happen, especially when things seem to be going really well, or when things are "too good to be true"... My other main thing is the last class period at school, I get extremely anxious and I get hot and sweaty and a weird feeling I cant explain all over my body.. Its like a warm, tingly feeling. It all goes away once the bell rings for that class to be over, and when I get to go home. 
I also get really bad anxiety when driving, I wake up every morning with that weird feeling, and a stomach ache, and every other time I have to drive somewhere, I get that feeling and start sweating. I am getting it even talking about this… I dont know what (if anything) I can do. I wish it would go away. The past few weeks, and especially the past few days, have gotten alot better , and I am not as nervous and anxious to drive. I plan on practicing alot this summer and on weekends, the more I drive, it does seem to be getting better and I hope it will eventaully be gone forever. 

**tl;dr** **#3** **-**  I have really bad anxiety and I don’t know what to do.. I can’t get professional help until I move away to college this fall, and I have never been diagnosed with anything. What tips would you give someone with anxiety that can’t get meds for it or anything yet? 

Thanks so much if anyone has read all of this, or any of it for that matter. It really means alot to me, and it really helps to vent and talk about this. I hope everyone has a good day.

I'm also very lonely and have no friends so you can guarantee I'll reply fast, unless when I'm sleeping. Disclaimer: I'm not asking for money or anything else in return, I just love psychotherapy. I'm not a proffesional or going to school to become one.*



I emphatise so much with you guys. I just read a post on here that made me cry. What schizophrenia does to people is one of the worst things ever, and you are all so brave for choosing to live another day. I, myself have had 2 psychotic breaks but no diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia and am doing alot better than when I was in the hospital. But I come here because I feel very traumatised by psychosis. I have a possibility of developing schizophrenia because of the 2 breaks I have had and I can tell you that that has made me cry hysterically many times. 


And I read stories here and it makes me really sad. I also do a lot of research on schizophrenia, psychotherapy and psychology in general, and I would like to lend a helping hand here to whoever needs it. My psychoses have made me value life and health so much when you're not psychotic and I currently am sane and would like to do some good while I can. I hope my sanity doesn't get ripped from me anytime soon, or ever. That would break me into a milion pieces.



I can be your non-proffessional therapist. Don't be shy about reaching out, cause I am very lonely and would love a conversation with you, especially if I can dig around your brain and maybe lessen your trauma (many studies say that schizophrenia is caused by trauma) and give you pointers about how to improve your mental state.

selftext: I have never been diagnosed but I suspect that I fall somewhere on the spectrum. I display a few symptoms that seem to fit the description: lack of interest in social interaction, desire to be alone, difficulty effectively communicating without a lot of effort come to mind. I don’t have any trouble reading other peoples’ emotions and expressions or picking up on other contextual clues though. Instead, my biggest problem in conversation is knowing what expressions I should be making with my face. I have been told  before that I make weird faces at incongruous times so I try to keep as dead-panned as possible not to weird anybody out.. of course if you do that too much though, it is also weird. If this a thing other people experience, a common Aspergers thing, or is this just my own personal neurosis? Curious what everyone else thinks.

Am I supposed to call my Dr. And tell him? Ask him for help? Is he going to commit me? Can he even up my meds or would I be wasting my time and making it worse? I know I need to do something, I'm just so afraid of what will happen if I try.

I don’t have thoughts about anything specific when I experience the physical symptoms. I’ve also never had a panic attack but my heart sometime feels like it’s racing on and off for an entire day. Does anyone else experience this/ have advice for figuring out WHY I’m feeling anxious? I want to get to this bottom of this. (I’m planning on finding a therapist in the fall, but hope to make progress in the meantime as this thing is feeling more and more burdensome.)
Thank you for any advice!

selftext: So I'm guessing you all saw my BPD thread (seeing it had 1,300+ views... which like, how?) There's a lot of PD shaming in this world, even by clinicians... they don't want to tell their clients about it because there's an even more serious stigma to it the more severe mental illnesses like bipolar. I wrote that thread because sadly, I see some of it here sometimes.

And since I can't get a fucking psychiatrist with my Poor People Health Insurance, I kept talking about how I feel like it's all because they see my record and the extent of my diagnoses... why would they think some pills could fix that level of crazy...

Cue to the end of our session. "I'll tell you I don't think you have BPD. If I was to think you had any personality disorder, it would be... histrionic."

Well, fuck me.

Do I think it fits? I mean, yeah. I'm a big guy who wears flashy t-shirts, has a full sleeve of tattoos, pierced ears/lip, and (as my therapist said was the first thing I told her) I'm "kind of an attention whore." Going mainstream was way too hard and just... awkward... so instead I kinda went the total opposite way. And like... I kinda like how I look?

But I always felt I was this way more from (hypo)mania, and that since I have such bad social anxiety at the same time, it just wasn't the right... fit. She said something like "maybe on the surface, but you have a lot of insight and are very aware of how you present to others."

So like... I don't know? At the very least, it's highly correlated with physical appearance, so maybe I have empirical evidence that I'm Dope AF.

Wondering what you guys think. I just don't get why this is really a problem...?

selftext: I was diagnosed when I was 22 and still studying Mechanical Engineering at college. I had only been there for a year but before I got my diagnosis I was starting to suspect that I was mentally impaired in some or another. I dropped out of said college and moved back in with my family. It took a while but I was finally able to get in with a doctor and start treatment for my ADHD.

Since I have started I have been on Welbutrin, Adderall, Vyvanse, and now Strattera. I have noticed no benefits from any of these medications, only drawbacks. I just feel so empty and fatigued all of the time. I know I should be productive and that I should be going to the gym but I just don't have the energy to do it. I hate it.

It's as if I've been given a glimpse of the happy, well adjusted, and successful person that I could have been. But I'm stuck in the timeline where I'm a useless little shit that can't get his act together cause his brain is broken and nothing helps. Although I'm enrolled to go to a trade school this fall I have this feeling that I'm going to mess it up just like I have everything else and that I'll end up dropping out of it as well.

So my question to you all is this: Is it at all possible for me to have a successful life where I can live on my own? Even as I'm typing this out it feels like my arms are about to snap off I'm so tired. But thanks to my ADHD I can't get any sleep so I always wake up completely exhausted. Why should I keep on living with such a shitty quality of life that's done nothing but get worse for the last couple of years?

TL:DR Brain is broken. Body is broken. No sleep thanks to ADHD. Life has only gotten worse for last couple of years. Why live?

selftext: I had a psychological evaluation following a suicide attempt and I told her about some of my symptoms for BPD but she didn’t want to go any further with checking symptoms for BPD as I wasn’t “impulsive enough”. But the reason I’m not impulsive enough is because I’ve got extreme social anxiety and am too afraid of being judged if I act impulsive despite having urges to be impulsive all the time. I have the majority of symptoms like lack of sense of self, extreme moods, abandonment issues, thinking someone is an angel one moment then thinking they’re the devil...I have all symptoms except I don’t act on my impulsivity (unless trying to kill myself because I was afraid my boyfriend would leave me counts). She only diagnosed me with Borderline traits because I wasn’t impulsive enough and wouldn’t listen to all the other symptoms that I show. The issue with this is she only offered me CBT (which I’ve had before) and in reality, I need something to stop me being self destructive and ruining relationships. CBT teaches more rational thinking rather than distorted thinking which has helped to some extent but when I am having a BPD episode, I can think all the rational thoughts in the world, in fact I am completely aware I am being irrational when I have an episode but the emotions are so overpowering that I am helpless to do anything about it... I am just so annoyed that I waited so long to be tested and I’m given no solutions to help me in my episodes. She also offered anger management?? But my episodes aren’t just anger, they’re self loathing, they’re episodes of extreme depression and guilt afterwards...it’s much more complicated than just anger. :/ I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’ll be stuck in this destructive cycle forever because no one will listen as I am not a “typical borderline”. :(

selftext: Warning: Very long post, not in a good mood

TL;DR - My mental health has been affecting my grades and my overall self image for years - why does no one take me seriously and blame me when I ask for help?

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, but I show a lot of the symptoms for ADD (almost all of the inattentive symptoms, some of the hyperactive symptoms, some of the impulsive symptoms), and as it so happens, I have family members who have been diagnosed with ADD in their adulthood (my dad, his older sister, both of her children, very possibly my older brother). My stepmother and stepbrother also have ADHD. 

It wasn't as bad when I was little - I'd constantly forget to turn in homework and would say and do things without thinking of the consequences, but because I'm a very quiet and shy girl, no one thought anything of it. But as I've gotten older, I've gone from being an honors student (6th and 7th grade) to barely passing my classes.  Some other issues with my mental health (mood swings, anxiety, body image, and self harm) have also worsened with time. But again, I'm a girl who was the "normal" one out of my siblings, so I was ignored, and still am when I bring up the need to be tested.

I'm 20 now. University has been hell. I feel like a failiure and an idiot. My relationship with food is unhealthy. I've come very close to committing suicide several times. Renting out an apartment has been hell and I don't have the money to pay for my utilities for this month. I always say that I'll do better next year, but it never goes through. I've tried opening up to people, but it's always my fault. After a disastrous talk with my stepmom, I decided to save up money and get my licence so I can get tested on my own.

Sorry for the long rant, just wanted to get this off my chest.

selftext: I was diagnosed in one session with a psychiatrist (that I stopped seeing, he raised major red flags) for Bipolar as I’ve had an episode 2 months ago so I recalled those symptoms to him and what I believed to be Borderline symptoms. Well my LCSW who was once sure I was bipolar suddenly doesn’t think I am anymore along with my therapist (who isn’t a real doc but works under one) is unsure of what disorder I have. I spoke to the LCSW today about me seeing my old psychiatrist soon for a second opinion and he said getting a diagnosis is important because I seem to need to be medicated. He also annoyingly said that most Bipolar people (when manic), go days without sleeping..... haha... could’ve sworn I told you I have this symptom a hundred times before???

Either way I can’t stop thinking about that coming psych appointment. I don’t get how no one is sure of my diagnosis when the answer seems so obvious to me. The LCSW even said I may still have only unipolar depression which I think is complete crap. There was a time where I was distinctly depressed and anxious, now I have those two and 26293939 million other problems. I’m afraid my old psychiatrist will say I’m only depressed and anxious and give me an SSRI and I go manic. There’s no way I can only be depressed after all these other symptoms I’ve developed in the past year. In one year I developed borderline/Personality Disorder(?) symptoms, bipolar symptoms, anger issues and a mild psychotic episode. 

My mental health has rapidly gotten worse and it feels I’m the only one who sees that. Anyone else felt like they caught on to a illness before a doc? And what can I do to calm down

selftext: Hi guys. I'm hoping someone here would have some relevant experience or insight. I'm not diagnosed as being ASD, although some of my cohorts think I could be, but I've been experiencing some kind of sensory issues.

Most descriptions of sensory overload and sensory integration issues I read about involved heightened senses that overwhelm. Like a filter is lifted, you can't sort through anything, every detail seems equally important, everything is brighter/louder/etc, and this can trigger a fight or flight response beyond conscious control.

What I'm experiencing is more the opposite: Shut\-down of sensory, like open\-eye blindness. Ever get tunnel vision? Ever have it progress to the point you feel like you're straining just to stay conscious to focus on an ever narrowing active focus? I "see" less and less, the "active" area of my vision shrinks. Sounds start going in one ear and out the other. I become increasingly irrational/irritable, usually squinting, making 'headache' type motions such as closing eyes and rubbing my face, but there's no physical or mental discomfort. It's more like an invisible pressure against my senses that I don't feel pushing them away, the absence of them. My coordination, body/position awareness, and general ability not be a clumsy oaf or even plan through my motions deteriorates pretty badly during this. The harder I strain against it to focus on having sensory input, the worse it gets.

This is often triggered by fatigue and/or too much stuff going on for too long. EG, socializing in a large crowd, etc, too much stuff to track. The remedy is to stop, go somewhere quiet, and meditate. The problem is, I can't get through the average day without experiencing it more than a few times during the workweek.

Any insights from people that have sensory overload/integration issues?

selftext: i've been depressed for probably my entire life--there isn't a time i can recall where how i felt wouldn't have been diagnosed as depression.  there were many toxic friendships and relationships and i didn't make any real friends until I hit college. it took that long for me to begin learning what healthy, positive friendships are. i still struggle with interacting with people because of it all. 


i feel completely lost. i don't know what I want or who i am. i don't have the energy to do the things i would like to do because i spend so much energy just trying to keep myself together. 


i've been in a relationship for about 3 years and would describe it as the only healthy relationship i've been in. more recently i met someone else who i wound up with feelings for and it made me start thinking about where my current relationship is going. is it still healthy if you're just staying because it isn't bad and you would be just fine staying in it? or should there be more?  i feel incredibly stupid for falling for someone else. 

i don't know who i am. i've almost started acting out of character. I hate hurting people so i don't want to end the relationship i'm in but i also feel incredibly stuck in life and just want to leave and start over. none of my friends live near me. i thought my desire to just up and leave everyone was mental illness acting up but even when i'm feeling fine, there's this nagging feeling to just leave and go off into the world alone for a little while. no one would understand it though. i don't have anyone i can even talk to about it really.  the last few days i've just been like lol i should just kill myself over every little thing. i have no plans to actually kill myself, i just have a strong desire to not exist.  there's just so much more on top of just this but this is the most prominent and current issue.

selftext: Hey all, been diagnosed for 5 years or so now. My mother and I have never had a perfect relationship, but lately she’s been exhibiting signs of BPD too, and both of my therapists agree she may very well be borderline. 

So what happened was I was sitting on the couch, trying to explain in a productive way that I feel lonely and that I feel like everyone tolerates me. Somehow, my mother took this personally and replied with “nothing I do is good enough for you, I don’t know what you want from me.”  She sat on the edge of the couch to hug me, which inadvertently got me pinned to the back of the couch. 

I started having a really bad reaction, and was screaming for her to get away from me. I’ve had this happen before, and my therapists advised my parents to give me space when this happens because I need to be left alone to calm down. This is not what my mother did. She got nose to nose with me and screamed at the top of her lungs “STOP IT! YOURE CRAZY! STOP IT!”

So I closed my eyes and pushed to get her away. When I opened my eyes she was on the ground. So she screamed for my dad to call 911. He didn’t. She got up and started shaking me and screaming STOP IT again. It took about another hour for things to calm down. 

Now I find out she told my brother that I’m verbally, emotionally and physically abusing her. I’ve never laid a finger on my mother out of malice or ill intent, and this is the first and only time I’ve ever defended myself. I don’t know what to do now, because she’s labeling me as an abuser when all I was doing was trying to calm down. Anyone got any words of wisdom for me?

selftext: So let me start by saying I am 25 years old, and in the past year and a half I have been diagnosed with comorbid ADHD and bipolar type II, and I don't take medication for it.  I don't have anything against anyone that does, and fully support the use when needed; I just don't feel like that's me. 

I recently left a sales job where I actually made 6 figures right before I left; however I didn't find it fulfilling, enjoyable, or exciting;  in short, the job made me hate myself and my life, and I found myself wanting to end it all pretty much all day every day. 

Cut forward about 5 months, and I really can't figure out what I want to do with my life. I'm currently working part time at my friend's popcorn shop while giving guitar lessons and driving for Uber/Lyft to make a living. Money isn't really that important to me, but I want something I can enjoy and find a purpose in my life with. 

I've been exploring a few ideas, with the main ones being carpentry and going fill time with guitar instruction; I've always been passionate about misicas it's something I've always been able to focus on easily compared to just about everything else in the world. I also enjoy building, putting things together, and finding ways to solve problems quickly with my hands (coming from someone on this sub, I'm sure that's no surprise). 

Have any of you out there been through something similar, or do any of you have any advice for what to do next to get myself figured out on this issue?  I've been struggling with it a lot lately and have found myself deep on thought about it, but I'd love to hear what some other people who understand what it's like to have ADHD have to say about this.

selftext: My boyfriend of a year and a half who has been truly the best person to ever enter my life is away at University for stretches of up to two months. I saw him two three weeks ago, yet a week ago over messaging he told me that before he went away (when he was at his dad's house) he went to the doctor and has been diagnosed with depression. This is after I crumpled a bit. I just crumpled and told him everything I was feeling and seeing and he said for me to see a doctor (me, being the pessimistic cunt I am, said no) and then he told me. I usually quietly brew for a few months and then go ballistic depressive mode with lots of crying about how much I love him and my dog and my cat and how I can't kill myself because of them yet I still want to kill myself. Or get hit by a bus. Both work. 

 I'm usually quite good at hiding the fact that I hate my life and myself but I just crumpled. I have GCSEs coming up and I have a shitty home situation and I miss him dearly and now I have him being in danger to himself and not having him here to watch over and take care of. It sounds so, so dumb but it's almost as if my heart gets pounded by a hammer every time I think about how he's not right and I'm powerless to make him feel better. I also feel immeasurably guilty for not seeing the signs sooner and not helping. To me, this is all my fault, the way he's like this. 

He's always such a happy person when he's around me and I couldn't piece it together at the time but now looking back the signs were there and I saw nothing. 

I just want to fade away or for him to appear on my doorstep tomorrow, honestly either works at this point I'm so done with being like this. I just want joy.

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD-CT about 3 months ago. I started taking meds and immediately realized that I needed to take them EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Well, Friday I went to the pharmacy to get my meds and the pharmacy said that it would be $247 because my insurance isn't covering it anymore. We had problems previously, but I was under the impression it was taken care of. So I call my insurance and they tell me that they have to get in touch with my doctor but, of course, my doctors office closes early on Fridays and they won't be able to get in touch until Monday. At first I was calm, but the more I thought about it, the more I began to panic. I have a final on Thursday that I'm really worried about because for the first time in my college life, I'm close to having a decent GPA.  I was terrified that I wouldn't have my medicine for my test and to study. Over the course of the weekend, I realize how bad I feel when I'm not on my medicine. I have no energy during the day, I'm getting depressed, I have NO motivation, and I'm overeating until I feel sick. Today I come home after being away for the weekend, and realize my fish has died which pulls me into a deeper depression than it should. I spend the majority of the day in bed, even though I'm supposed to be cleaning my room to help my parents prepare for painters. This evening, I get a call from my insurance company saying that everything is straightened out so I IMMEDIATELY run to the pharmacy and pick it up. I'm laying in bed tonight almost in tears of joy because I'll feel normal tomorrow. 

TL;DR I really freaking need my medicine and I'm so happy I'll have it back tomorrow.

selftext: So I’m back to questioning my diagnosis I don’t know if I really have bipolar. I was diagnosed with type 2 then 1 but I think it’s a big mistake the doctors made…I have never even hit hypomania let alone mania I mean sure I go to the gym at 5am but so what I like it there it’s my sanctuary and it’s not like I’m doing something bad I’m exercising and letting go of some of the energy bent up inside me so it helps but they don’t want me doing it at 5am I have to go some other time but I don’t have another time. I go to bed at 7pm but I don’t fall asleep for 2 hours sometimes I only sleep 4 hours but I wake up fine they just don’t listen to me when I say that. 

I’m on wellbutrin and abilify but I recently stopped my abilify because I was no longer convinced that I’m bipolar. I don’t feel any different in fact I feel the wellbutrin is working even better than it did before like the abilify was holding me back from achieving my potential. I found an internship that I like but the doctor asked if I was up for it….of course I’m up for it. I can workout and go to work and see friends without it being mania so why is everything seen through these lenses?

I told the doctor I’m doing fine and she agreed to not see me for 6 weeks so I’m happy about it because at least they won’t change my meds for 6 weeks and I get to keep taking wellbutrin which single\-handedly pulled me out of depression and is making me feel alive again. I really feel like I’ll get my shit together this time but the doctor and social worker don’t believe me and are thinking it’s a start of hypomania.

selftext: March 4, 2013, I was diagnosed with Stage 2B Hodgkins Lymphoma. I went through 8 rounds of IV chemo, and on August 8 I was declared in remission. In three months, I’ll be declared officially cancer-free. Despite this, I wish the lymphoma killed me.

During treatment, I began smoking marijuana twice daily to help with nausea and pain. It ended up doing wonders for my depression as well. After I went in remission, I kept smoking. I’m now pretty much dependent on it.

I lost my job (pharmacy technician) two years ago because of a mental breakdown. My coworker was sabotaging my work, deleting phone call records and shredding faxes I had sent and saved. I brought it up to management, who ignored me, and I threatened to kill myself one day in the parking lot, which prompted a hospital visit. 

About eight months ago, I had another mental breakdown and threatened suicide in front of my wife, who called the police, and I was taken again to the hospital. This time, I was deemed 5150-necessary, and had a 72-hour stay in a psych facility. I was boarded with drug addicts and patients with psychosis/dementia, and I feel I didn’t get the help I needed.

I was assigned outpatient treatment, which I completed, and I never followed up with any of my doctors because I always feel ignored. I haven’t been to a therapy session since last October and I haven’t had my meds refilled in about two months.

I’ve completely wasted the second chance I was given in life. I’m still jobless, basically addicted to marijuana, and aside from my wife (who works 60-hour weeks to support us), I feel like no one is truly here for me, and even she is starting to break.

selftext: I'm a 24 year old female from the US, and I feel like I'm incapable of being a stable person leading a normal life.

When I was a kid I was labeled "emotionally disturbed," saw several therapists, and was put in Special Ed for a year. I was constantly in trouble for being disorganized, not doing classwork and homework, making inappropriate comments, and not getting along with other kids. I had suicidal thoughts since I was seven. The only thing I've been diagnosed with is depression.

In high school I was more stable and had friends, but I still made poor grades from not doing homework. I only did well in classes that I was interested in. Halfway through my senior year, I went into a severe depression that lasted for the next three years. 

I never went to college and have only worked minimum wage jobs since. I've moved out of my mother's house and live in another state, but I work at Starbucks and still don't drive. I've had several driving teachers but have never taken the road test, and have severe driving anxiety, especially as I've already been in a bad accident. There's so many things I want to do, but I can't focus on any of them enough and inevitably fail to finish anything I start.

I feel like a failure and am embarrassed at how bad I am at being an adult. I'd rather kill myself now than spend my entire life being a loser. I come from an unstable and abusive home but I don't think it's enough to excuse what a failure I've become. I don't know if it's just anxiety or some sort of mood disorder or what, but I know there's something wrong with me and I don't know what I should do about it. Any advice is appreciated.

(I'm sorry for the long rant, but I didn't get to see my therapist this week and I have no one else to talk to.)

selftext: Thank you very much for answering the questions here! The patient in question has been diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis two weeks ago and was put on medication (Isoniazid, Rifampin, Ethambutol, and Pyrazinamide). In total, she consumes 11 pills a day including a Vitamin B6 supplement.


Before I proceed, here are the vital details:


* Age: 30
* Height: 5 ft 1 in (155 cm)
* Weight: 66 kgs (145 lbs)
* Gender: Female
* Medications you take: INH, RIF, EMB, PZA, Vit. B6.
* Smoking status: Never a smoker.
* Previous medical issues: Was chosen for latent Tuberculosis 6 years ago. Chose not to treat herself at the time.
* Current medical issues: Active Tuberculosis.
* Duration of complaint: 14 days.
* Location of complaint: Unsure how to answer this question / does not apply.


Here are my questions:

* She is suffering from bad loss of taste. Her appetite is very low (understandably so), but her taste sense is much worse. She cries (not exaggerating) every time she consumes food since she cannot really taste it well. Her spouse takes so much time and care to cook her delicious and healthy food, but she is simply unable to appreciate the taste. *What can be done to improve her taste and appetite?*
* Two weeks ago, she submitted her sputum samples for TB testing. While two results were negative, one was equivocally positive for Acid Fast bacilli. Recently, she sent sputum samples again and one sample was negative, while two were again equivocally positive. How is this possible? After consuming rigorous medications for 10 days, you would expect the situation to have improved isn't it?
* Her hands are shaking all the time. Her doctor says it is nothing to worry about and is not necessarily a side effect of any of the drugs she is consuming currently. Should she be worried?


Again, thanks a ton for your time! :)

I've had depression since I was a kid so I've learned tricks to try and bring myself back up. He's been diagnosed with BiPolar Disorder however he hasn't had a thorough enough evaluation to know if that is the case. He suffers from sudden bursts of depressive states where he is unable to function at work or at home. I'm the type of person where I put others before myself to the point where I stop taking care of myself. When he has these episodes I through all of myself into helping him come back up. Whether its doing all the errands, cooking, cleaning, or trying to get him out of the house for fresh air or doing anything I can to make him smile. This time however I'm having the worst depressive episode than I have had in my entire life. I'm fighting to stay above water and fighting for every gasp of air I can get. I can't take care of both of us. My homework from my therapist is to be selfish and to take care of myself but I feel the only way I can do that is if I'm not at home with him. Because if I'm at home with him he's the priority. It also doesn't help that I don't think he knows how to take care of me when I'm like this and its even harder for him to try to do it when he's struggling too. 

So I guess after all of this my question to the world of reddit is how do I be selfish but I also can be there for him? Or how do I be selfish in a way that doesn't make him think I'm leaving him in his time of need?

Also he is an avid Redditor so I'm sure theres a high likelihood that he will see this and know I wrote it so maybe if anyone has any tips and tricks to help him that would help too.

selftext: I'm a 32 year old Caucasian male based in Ireland, I weigh 80kg and I'm 6'1. I'm currently on inderal and lyrica for acute anxiety (meds have been very effective). I've been told I have intolerances to wheat, corn, yeast, and chicken. I smoke a couple times a week and vape daily. I had a very violent childhood and while I have not been diagnosed I would say it's highly likely I have ptsd.

These complaints are all in my neck and head region. 

1. It feels as if there's a weight in my neck near my throat on the left side spanning from below my collar bone to under my jaw. I have difficulty swallowing and I can no longer sleep on my left side as it is so uncomfortable, however I experience discomfort all day everyday. I have been to a throat specialist and they watched me swallow with and without food via a camera down my nose and everything looked good, in-fact they looked at me like I was a crazy idiot and I was quickly ushered out of the hospital.
2. I have tinnitus in my left ear which is louder than someone shouting right next to me, the tapping on the base of my skull trick works only for a second or two for me
3. I have visual snow, meaning there's a sort of television static overlay on my sight with my eyes open or closed, all doctors I've seen just smile and nod when I mention this. The trick of watching a video of static does work for me for a short time.

I also get brain fog, irritability, and bouts of exhaustion and depression.

I feel like the symptoms in my neck and head are most likely of the same cause. I'm not really sure how to proceed from here.

Thank you for reading

selftext: 28, female, 5'7", approx 225 pounds. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and bipolar disorder. I was hospitalized briefly last year because they found TnT enzyme (I think that's what they called it) in my blood, but ultimately decided it was nothing.

Anyway, lately I've just been feeling awful. I'm exhausted, I keep having moments where I feel like I can't breathe, and I have been having *strangely constant* pain. Less generalized and more focused. Most of it is in my upper left chest (feels like I pulled a muscle, but it's lasted for months), my upper arms (both sides), my stomach (mostly my left side; feels like something is in there that shouldn't be), and my jaw (right side). I've also been having this weird, stabbing pain between my shoulder blades. My left leg has been hurting worse than usual and the foot/ankle on that side seems to swell a lot? I lose feeling in it sometimes. The other one's fine.

I've been to the doctor before I lost my insurance and basically was told that it was anxiety. That stress can mess you up in weird ways. The pain and numbness was explained away as fibromyalgia. I just accepted it because... well, that's what doctors are for, I guess. To know better than you.

But it's been getting worse and I'm a little worried because I guess it's hard to believe anxiety can cause me to feel this bad? Coupled with the fact that I had sketchy blood tests last year and the revelation that my family actually has a LOT of medical problems I was previously unaware of (cancer, strokes, heart problems, etc), I'm concerned.

Does this sound like anxiety and do I just need to calm down? Or would it be worth it to maybe hope I can pay for an urgent care and make an appointment?

selftext: I didn't know whether to post this in /r/anxiety or /r/depression but for me it all started with anxiety. My anxiety makes me depressed, and the depressed feeling makes me anxious, makes me cry, makes me doubt my future. I can't eat because from the moment I wake up I have an extremely nervous feeling in my stomach and guts. I've got weeks where I feel very good and then there are weeks where I'm depressed. Other weeks I even feel emotionless. This in turn makes me anxious as hell because I feel like a burden for other people as well because I can't hold back my tears or come across as irritable. Will I ever be emotionally stable? Can I ever settle down, get a job, raise a family without hurting others with my anxiety and sadness?

I've been diagnosed with GAD with social anxiety, had therapy, am on escitalopram and now my therapy sessions are over. I can handle the panic attacks now. I'm not that afraid anymore of what other people think of me. But those periods of sadness, constant nervousness and the uncertainty of when I will become sad/depressed again are killing me. I know that they mostly go over soon, but they keep coming back.

I'm on escitalopram for one year now and it has worked really well for 10 months. But the periods of sadness and anxiety about that have become more intense for about two months now. Maybe my meds stopped working for me? I will definitely talk to my doctor about that.

Sorry for the vent. I just had to get this off my chest. Are there others that can relate to intense periods of sadness, emotionlessness or constant nervousness? How did you learn to live with it? How do your family and friends take it?

selftext: I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2014 by a behavioral clinic in KY, and received medication through them and my family physician (after I could no longer go to the clinic for work/school reasons). I moved to TN in September, and my physician here has a very negative attitude toward ADHD medication and ADHD as well. During the first few months of me living here, I still got prescriptions through my Dr in KY, but once I switched to the one here he was very hesitant to give me anything to help. He said it would lead to "heart attacks, strokes, and seizures" later on in life, and to help myself I should just "make a list" and "concentrate harder". He also said if I wanted to keep my medication, I should schedule a re-evaluation.  

I have since been unmedicated for about 2 months now, and have scheduled a re-evaluation for this coming thursday. The past two months have been hell for me at work (not working at my full potential, no motivation, distracted AF, etc.), and I just want to feel some sort of normalcy again -- either through medicine or otherwise. Should I be worried my Dr won't cooperate? He's already shown he thinks of ADHD as a willpower problem rather than an issue with my brain.   

If he DOES end up cooperating like I need him to, how long should I expect to be "okay" again? I really need to get my ducks in a row and my brain in order - I don't think I can without a little extra help from medication. 

TL;DR: Getting re-evaluated for ADHD at Dr this week -- what can I expect from him and how long will I have to wait until (or if) I'm back on medication?

selftext: Hey... Uh so I feel like strange because I've been seeing and hearing things and I know they aren't anxiety or panic attacks. The problem is I'm a female in highschool and well I have these almost... Episodes I guess where I feel like I'm being controlled by a demon inside of me. About a week ago I had one of those 'episodes' and I could hear my bone crack and the blood drip onto my clothes as he was crawling out of my chest and it set off such an alarm and panic and I started texting my friend because I was so scared but, she just called me crazy and said I had to go to a teacher or else she would call the cops on me because I was clawing my skin trying to withdraw blood to get him out because I believe he is in my blood. Then I had another one where I was outside shopping and I just for no real reason went cold and felt like he was in my shins, like the bone itself and I needed to break them with a hammer to get him out. Whenever this happens I get restless and tense up and shake a lot. My parents think I'm faking it but it's been making me feel so lonely and like... Truly alone and that nobody understand how I feel. 

A couple of weeks back I went to the hospital and that really didn't help me, it just made it worse and the doctors thought for a hot minute i might've been psychotic but because I kept to myself as much as I could and I just wanted to leave I forced myself to act okay which really took a toll on me. I was diagnosed with Depression, Social Anxiety, Adjustment Disorder, and ADHD. Everyone just thinks it's my anxiety that causes it but it isn't because I see these things then I just loose it.

H/W: \~\`5'6 and 160lb

Gender: Male

Meds: Adderall 40mg/day     Sertraline 100mg/day

Non\-smoker, no tobacco use. Some past marijuana use  \(almost daily from ages 20\-24 but have barely smoked it since then\)

\-\-Medical Issues\-\-

I'm a second\-semester physician assistant student who is worried about my health, specifically cardiac health. I've been diagnosed with ADD and depression which I would say is controlled by the psychiatric NP i see every 1\-3 months. I take 40mg of adderall a day, usually 15mg in AM before class, 10mg after lunch, and another 15mg in the afternoon. I notice a big difference without it \- i'll lose focus easily, have social anxiety, worsened depression, forget assignments. Sometimes I feel like I need maybe 50\-60 mg instead of 40.

So with my adderall, plus the coffee \(anywhere between 1\-3 cups a day\), plus the stress of PA school... I'm kinda worried what kind of potential health risks I could have going on here. I will occasionally have chest tightness/mild pain when my adderall kicks in. My family history is relevant for cardiac issues... 2 uncles on my dads side passed away from heart attacks in their late 50's \- early 60's. I try to get daily exercise \(at least 30 mins a day\) but honestly i'm lucky to do that 2\-3 times a week because of how busy I am with school. I try to eat healthy \(sometimes worry about my fat intake\) and being on the adderall means I eat pretty light lunches and dinners most days.

So really I guess I just want to know... Should I be this paranoid? Should I go see a PCP? What kind of lifestyle/diet modifications can I make to prevent heart complications in the future?

selftext: Age. 15.


Recently I was diagnosed with Pre Diabetes (which is from my picky diet and my moms inability to make edible food.), This might sound very normal for an American. But its not when you conciser i'm 110 (or 50 kilo) and 5'3 (164 cm).

My mom has no idea how to structure a diet, and IS LITERALLY KILLING ME! Today for dinner, I was fed fried Steak. And I feel like I need to run away from this abusive situation. My mom has stripped almost all liberties from me, if I ever had them to begin with. 

Even then my ability to cook for myself is nonexistent. The only food source that won't kill me in the house is Meat. and If i made meat for myself, my mom would rush me to the hospital.

I really cant leave the house without her. One time I walked 1.5 miles from school. And she told me never to do it again because "YOU COULD OF DIED! YOU KNOW (illogical, incoherent anecdotal point)".

I've also lost most ambition to do almost anything. So im failing my grades by miles. 65 is passing, in Math i have a 24 and in biology I have a 11.

I have no real friends to take me in. I have no car, or bike, or really any way to leave apart from foot.

But I really need to get out before I need insulin to maintain life. I don't know how i'd even live on the road, but Its becoming more and more of a possibility as my health tapers off.

If I don't run in time of diabetes, I' might wait until im 18 or suicide. 

Does anyone have any tips at all, on how to get away from this situation. And no, CPS is not an option. I've been conditioned way too hard by my mom to call it, its psychologically near in possible.

selftext: I am a 26 y/o white male, who is 6 foot and around 150 pounds with no preexisting medical condition or medication. 
Awhile ago I was diagnosed with hyperhydrosis which is related to my anxiety - I tend to get very sweaty palms. For a long time this was never really an issue, apart from me often giving a very sweaty handshake, but in recent years I have started to sweat a lot in my groin region. 

Again this has been fine, 2 summers ago I had extreme jock itch as a result of this, but since then have had nothing as bad as that as I have kept it dry down there with either talcum powder or sudocrem (I just use sudocrem now basically). 

The groin area itself is pretty manageable, its my rectum which is an issue. If I have been sweating a lot, often the skin is painful and cracks open at the seams if I pull my buttcheeks apart. Again, I have been managing this too with sudocrem which seems to help for the most part. As time has gone on however, my actual hole itself has become cracked or damaged or something so that it often stings when I defecate, and then when I wipe there is blood. I am 100% certain this is to do with the sweating. 

I saw a doctor about a year ago about groinal stuff and it seems like theres nothing much that can be done to prevent sweating (apart from antipersp or surgery neither of which I want to do down below) so I was wondering if there is anything that can prevent the cracking or pain around the hole? It comes and goes depending on how much I've sweated but as the weather has got hotter I have noticed that it has got a bit worse and I want to deal with this now. 

Thanks!

selftext: First, the basics: 

I am 24 years old, 6 foot 1 inch and weigh 250 pounds. 
I do not smoke and take no medications. 
I have been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and was told at my previous physical in January that I had a slightly higher cholesterol level than I should and higher blood pressure. 

Since December I have been getting these occasional headaches all on the left side of my head and directly behind my eye. I only really began to notice them because I rarely get headaches and it seemed peculiar to me. They are very very dull and last only a few seconds, but they happen throughout the day. I also feel lately that my memory has sort of been bad too. I will be talking to people and I will forget phrases or what I meant to say. This is sort of unusual for me and something I have also noticed. 

I finally decided to do something about it and went to my doctor in January. He did everything he could but only suggested taking a large dose of ibuprofen over three days to see if we could “calm any inflammation down”. I wasn’t too happy with that response but it did help for those three days for sure and seemed to break the cycle for a while. Though they still come and go. On my own I checked my eyes and teeth (in case it was either a problem with my vision or I needed a root canal in a problem tooth) and both were reported to be fine. 

I will eventually go back to my doctor, but I wonder what I should be asking him to check? And how to stress to him that I feel this is different. I may very well be over thinking this which I realize I tend to do. Any help identifying what this could be, and next steps with my doctor would be appreciated.

selftext: I’ve been suicidal since I was 16. I’ve tried to commit suicide 3 times in my life: at 16, at 21, and about 2 years ago at 26. I was diagnosed with PTSD after the third attempt but I know I’ve had it years before then. 

I was listening to a true crime podcast and it was covering a case of a suicidal young woman who hired some one off craigslist to kill her. He eventually got jail time for her murder and although it was never proven that she actually did hire him to do so, I was still intrigued by the idea. 

I get paid once a month on the first day of the month, every single time I get my pay check I think “ok, I can pay all my bills and groceries and what not......or I can use every cent to pay some one to kill me”. 

I also purposely put myself in danger in hopes of dying. I’ve been going on tinder dates but I stopped telling my friends who I’m meeting and where I’m meeting them at. When I meet these strangers about 80% of me is hoping they murder me before I get home. 

I know it’s selfish of me to think this way but the depression is eating away every rational or logical brain cell left in me. 

No one checks up on me or takes care of me. I have no partner or some one who considers me their “#1”. If I were to kill myself on a Friday night, my body would rot all through out the weekend and the only person who would notice that I’m gone would be my boss after not reporting to work on Monday. 

I don’t know what the solution is. I’m too chicken shit to off myself because I already tried 3 times and the last time left some lasting scars. I just want some one to do it for me

selftext: I always look at my past even somewhat present pass as always much better then how things are for me now yet in all honestly things have gone from bad to worse. Every interaction I have with another person feels so forced and takes so much energy so I isolate. I'm 25, pregnant and due in August. There are two possible dads, both hate me and hate that I didn't abort. One is a friend I've had for ages who I randomly decided to cheat with while with the other possible dad who was my bf at time. We are obviously no longer together and we have NC. 

I reacted by attempting suicide which lead me into a mental hospital for a few weeks. Everyone I know knows I'm mentally unwell and I feel like a freak. I'm an alcoholic and all I want to do is drink but I did that during early pregnancy and heavily the day I wanted out and can't drink again. I'm not suicidal anymore, just heavily depressed.

I'm 25 and live at home with mum who tries so hard to support me and I appreciate it but I'm so overwhelmed by everything. 

I don't even try or care to get validation from others anymore (will probably change when I can drink and am not pregnant but I'm hoping to not fall back into that). 

I'm just living without any real emotions or feelings except insane anxiety all the time. I smoke weed and that helps momentarily. I go to AA and do my treatment classes and appointments to do with being pregnant and that's it. 

I'm lazy as shit, depressed as fuck and the slightest bit of responsibility scares the shit out of me. Only good thing that's come from this is being diagnosed as being major depressed and having BPD meaning I am getting treatment for that. I also have sensory issues and am majorly sensitive which explains a lot to how I was as a child.

I feel so insane.

2013 was an eventful year for me. I graduated, found a dream job for freshers, got love confession rejected, struggled at job and quit after only 3 days. I constantly had suicidal thoughts so I decided to see a doctor. I was diagnosed with depression. I took pills as instructed for 2 or 3 months. The pills did help me not to overthink but I stopped because I was short on money and I supposed depression was just my imagination. In 2014, I got a new job, worked as an editor in the school that I graduated. The job was like heaven: nice people, flexible work hour and fair salary. There were ups and downs, but overall, I felt content. Unfortunately, my publishing department got abolished after reorganization and I was jobless. However, I enjoyed my time at home with freelance tasks now and then but as you guys can guess, the income is not stable. So, I tried to apply for full\-times and I was lucky enough to get my current job which is not related to book publishing, but still about translation and localization. The people here are nice, they even encourage me when they see that I feel down. The only thing that missing is that I couldnt work with books like before.

Long story short:

\- I want to quit my job although it seems great in every aspect.

\- I want to crash myself into a truck or something although my life is good \(loving family, financially stable\) so that I dont have to come up for work tomorrow.

\- I feel like I'm a failure if I quit my job now. I just want to be helpful to the society.

selftext: I had a friend in grad school, we'll call him Tom, that was a nice quiet guy. We would grab drinks occasionally and go to the gym together once in awhile. We weren't really good friends and lost touch for the most part after graduation. That was six years ago. I haven't seen Tom since, but I would get a text from him once or twice a year just saying "Hi" or something innocuous.

A few weeks ago Tom said he had moved closer to where I was living and wanted to meet up. I didn't think twice about it and we planned to grab dinner and go to a movie. Holy **** that's when things got really, really uncomfortable. Tom became obsessed about the movie and started sending me clips, reviews, trailers, and knew everything about everyone in it. When we met up it was all he could talk about. He also started:

- Mirroring my every action. If I took a bite of food he would do the same thing. He ordered everything the same as me with the exact same words to the waitress.

- He revealed that he would talk to plants and they would sing to him, because he had no friends

- I commented that I liked the shirt he was wearing and he said he had burned the same shirt a few times before.

- He said really lewd inappropriate things out of nowhere and then dropped it.

- He told me his hobby was carving donuts into trees

- He showed me a handful of pills and said "this keeps the bad people away" and that he was diagnosed with some mental issues

- He told me that he "would golf with the penguins if the summer didn't sit"

None of the above was joking.

Needless to say I was concerned and I tried to make sure Tom had a good time. I know that he's clearly got some serious issues. I don't want to be around him. Does that make me a bad person? Do I have a responsibility to be his friend?

selftext: 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder.  At first, I was prescribed an SSRI treatment, which I tried several types of, and never managed to get past the initial period when you only experience the horrible side effects, before your body adjusts to it and start feeling better. The longest I have been on it was never more than a week. I think I developed a kind of fear from this type of medication.

Needless to say, my disorder has gotten much worse over the years, while I also developed a very bad case of Hypochondria, that made me much more miserable. Despite the extreme misery, I still managed to lead a functional life.

I have been seeing my Therapist on and off , and yesterday was my first therapy session in a year and a half. I guess I got to my lowest point, and she managed to convince me to give medication another chance, as she believes I just got so used to living like this, that I forgot how a normal life feels like, and stopped realizing how depressed I am. This hit me hard enough that I agreed to finally give it another chance.

Today is my second day on Cipralex with Lexotanil, and I have experienced minor side effects, such as nausea, headache, restlessness, and just feeling foggy. I just hope I make it through this time, and finally start feeling better.

I don’t know why I am posting on here to be honest, but I guess I just want to share this with people who actually understand how all this feels.  As much as my Family and Friends have been supportive, but It’s so frustrating that they never really understand how hard and overwhelming being like this is. 

Also, any insights, advise, motivation will be much appreciated :)

I hope you guys are pulling through, and feeling wonderful. Thank you.

selftext: My best friend of twenty years lost her father last year, has chronic health issues that cause her serious stress. over the last few years, our lives have gone in very different directions but we have always remained close. 

However, she has begun to lash out at me. It is happening more and more and over trivial things - berating me aggressively for liking a tv show she hasn't even seen, flying into a rage when I put plates in the wrong place in her kitchen etc. A torrent of rage sits just below the surface. 

I grew up being aggressively verbally shamed and humiliated. I have had therapy to deal with these issues and how they manifest in my own life. This led to me being diagnosed with PTSD. I am finding her aggression triggering. 

I don't know how to talk to her about this but we can't continue like this. I respect and have compassion for the fact that her anger is coming from a place of pain. I don't expect to be able to help or change this. However, i need a strategy for my own self-care and in order to continue to support her and would appreciate your advice. 

I am wondering whether continuing to support her means taking a few steps back from our friendship but that makes me feel like i am failing her when she needs me the most. Several friends have curtailed their relationship with her because of this behaviour.  She won't talk to me or anyone about it and I am at a loss. I can't keep putting myself in this situation. The last time we spent the afternoon together she put me down repeatedly and I felt like worthless shit the next day. I know that communicating and exercising my own boundaries regarding this behaviour is vital but i have no idea how to do that without her losing her temper.

I had initially confused the date and thought it was midday friday \(today\).

As the last person to finish their part, I was to be the one to upload it.  I only found out it was due thursday about half an hour after the due date when a group member messaged me asking if I'd submitted it.

This was a massive pain and a lot of stress in itself but luckily my uni gave me a 24hr extension to complete and submit it.

I finished my part by 6pm and went to upload it to turnitin \(basically a copyright checking software\).

So I went to upload it instantly, and while it was uploading decided to check my emails.

Of course, I never went back to it to submit the uploaded file and when I went to turn off my PC later, it never got uploaded.

Fast forward to about 2pm today. Picture me, all happy about finishing my last piece of coursework for the year getting another message from the group again, double checking its been uploaded.

I message back yep, all done dont worry.

So I check my emails just in case to see if I had the turnitin reciept, and of course I dont.

So now I have to tell the rest of the group that for a 2nd time I forgot to upload the file, and im not sure I can get an extension on this one. 

I'll feel so bad if they lose marks bc im a fucking idiot.

I'm not looking for advice, this post is more just to rant.

P.S.

I was only diagnosed in december, and because the NHS is terrible. I dont have access to any medication or support, other than an email describing my specific condition.

Cheers for listening

selftext: Again.
Little back story. It started when I was in Jr high(2009ish). I would come home to my mom and step dad fighting all the time. Some days worse than others. Most of the time my mom would just leave for a couple hours then be fine when she got home. Other days she would lock herself in the bathroom and try to take a bunch of pills. She was in and out of the hospital many occasions. Being a teenager I didn't know what to do. She finally went to get help and was diagnosed with bipolar and depression. She started going to a therapist and got on normal medications. She was doing good for a few years with only a few issues. (none to serious)
Today I get a call from my brother that my step dad had to call the cops because my mom had tried to end her life with pills again. When he tried to stop her she got very upset and told him to get a gun and kill her and himself. Once the cops came she agreed to go to the hospital and get the help she needs.

Everytime she goes through these "episodes" she tells us that we (my 2 brothers, my step dad and I) don't love her, and that we only take advantage of her. No matter how much we call her, talk to her, visit her and go out to do fun things with her, she always feels like we hate her. It's been rough not knowing what to say or do anymore. Growing up with a mom like this is so tough. Everyone I talk to doesnt truly understand. I try to talk to my husband and he helps calm me but again he doesn't get it.

I feel so damn bad that I don't understand how or why my mom is feeling like we are better off without her. It hurts. I just dont know.

selftext: Everything is my fault.  I was diagnosed with Crohns disease when I was a teen.  My husband knew I was sick when he married me.  The entire time we dated, I never had a flare.  So he knew I was sick, but had never seen it.  Fast forward 20 years of on and off flares and a very high risk pregnancy......our daughter is now a teen.  My Crohns has become so bad I cannot work.  I am to sick to work but not sick enough for disability.  The last two years my flares have been almost back to back.  The last month I have been hospitalized.  The worst was the ischemic stroke I suffered.  

My illness has vastly exceeded my FMLA so I have lost my employment.  This has caused us to lose our house and has forced us to move in with family.  I had several auto withdrawals set up when I was working.   I tried to put a stop pay on them but two still cleared causeing overdrafts.  My husband is so mad at me that he now isn't talking to me.  It may be better than him yelling at me but silence is also painful.  He maintains this silence even in front of our daughter.  He blames me for everything.  Not being able to pay our bills because I have not worked, to our losing the house, to our moving in with family, to the overdrafts.  All of this is my fault and he never misses an opportunity to tell me.  

I have a large life insurance policy......he would never have to worry about money.  He always said he would rather have me than the money.  Now he says nothing.  Maybe it is time to solve the problem of "me" permanently.  I have the means, I have the plan......I just don't know what I am supposed to do.    I don't know what the right thing is.  My death would probably be my fault too....

selftext: I'm a teacher. This is my third year teaching HS math, and I almost lost my mind. The students are awesome, the teachers suck. 

The whole reason I became a teacher is to give students that one teacher who actually cares about them. To NOT be like the miserable teachers I had growing up. I have succeeded, but it has cost me so much.

I realized this year that those miserable teachers never went away. Now instead of being taught by them, I work with them. They like you as long as you sit in your little box and do what your told. I hate boxes. 

My misery brought forth my mental health issues that were well under control previous years. I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder, General Anxiety and ADHD. For the past year, they have all teamed up to tear my life apart.

Before this year I had a perfect performance review for teaching and responsibilities. This year my depression led to oversleeping, extra absences, forgetting responsibilities and not hanging out with people in my department. They all think I'm a lazy a piece of shit and have taken no mental heath issues into consideration. 

In addition, I started self harming by hitting myself and cutting. I actually spent my spring break in a Psych hospital it was so bad. I had seen psychs, docs and a therapist through the year but we could never get it right until these past couple of weeks.

I could tell them and reconcile, then they'd probably feel like shit, but I don't know if that's a good idea. I might tell 1 person that does like me and let it leak out that way. We have 6 days left then I'm moving states so who cares if they know.

Everything is starting to get better and I'm almost done, so should I tell them or not?

selftext: Hi, r/SLP,

I was recently asked to help cover a different facility, one whose caseload involves patients with tracheostomy/vent or who have diagnoses and conditions that are much more severe than at my primary location. Overall, although I started off a little out of my depth, it's been a tremendous learning experience every day and a step in the right direction for the type of setting I want to work in. However, working with a few patients left me with some questions that I haven't been able to answer for myself yet.


Specifically, are there any resources, strategies, and/or cueing methods to assist in eliciting a voluntary cough for patients who, for example, are post CVA resulting in dysphagia and impaired cough strength? These are patients who have been seen (by the previous SLP) and continue to be seen for respiratory muscle strength training, and seem to be doing well during training; a weak reflexive cough was noted occasionally over the course of treatment, but when attempting to perform a voluntary cough, the patients can often only do a throat clear and on the whole rely on throat clears over reflexive coughs, as well.


Ultimately, I think the previous SLP's goal in these situations was to facilitate a cough to help with clearing secretions and improving airway protection if she began therapeutic PO trials. Unfortunately, I don't have the contact info to be able to consult her on these things yet. 


Most of the resources I've come across so far have been for RMST and a few for cough reflex testing (which I wouldn't know the first thing about administering), so I hoped to turn here to determine if it's possibly a case of needing to perform RMST longer or if there is something I should try that I'm just not aware of.

I appreciate any feedback/resources.

selftext: I've been diagnosed with and treated for ADHD since I was 12. I'm now 30, a full\-time premed student at an amazing school and my finals are less than 2 weeks away. I had a doctor's appointment this morning, but my doctor's office called me and told me the doctor would not be in the office for my appointment \(this is frustrating, because it's a three hour drive to get to my psychiatrist, and I had already driven there and missed 2 classes today for the appointment\). The next available appointment is not until the week after finals. My GP is a nurse practitioner, who is legally unable to prescribe my medications. I am on state insurance, so my coverage in the area is extremely limited.

I would go without, but there are measurable effects from withdrawals when you've been on medications like this for years, and they can impede your ability to do basic things for awhile, let alone perform well on a physical chemistry exam. 

 Given that this is a controlled substance, I don't think I can go into a walk\-in clinic and request it. I'm apprehensive of going to the emergency room, because as anyone who has ever experienced this kind of situation, you're written off as a drug addict when you ask for med refills like this.  I am unsure of what I can do to make sure I am treated through finals. Does anyone know how to go about requesting continued care in this circumstance? If I fail this quarter, I will lose my scholarships, and can't afford school on my own. Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR: My meds are out, my doctor rescheduled my appointment at the last minute and finals are approaching. How do I get my medication when everyone assumes people that uses these medications are abusing them?

Also I'm in the US so my knowledge of how this works for our international posters is zero so if anyone does know anything about other countries laws feel free to share.

The American's with Disabilities Act protects disabled individuals in multiple areas including employment. Mental illness falls under this category. Depression can be iffy depending on how it's diagnosed, it needs to be proven it affects at least one major life activity. Mental illness is the second most covered disability in the workplace, only back injuries are more common. Even addiction is included in mental illness.

They can't ask you about disabilities on an application, only after you've accepted.

You don't have to share your disability with your employer but if you don't you can't seek accommodations. 

If you need accommodations you don't have to be specific, you don't need to say, I'm struggling with the morning shift because my lithium knocks me the fuck out. You can say, I take strong medication for a health problem and its hard to get up for the early shift. If you have a disability on file it's reasonable they switch you to afternoons. If you don't they just may think you hate mornings.

You don't even have to tell them the diagnosis or disability, just what parts of your job are hard for you and what suggestions you have to make it easier. They can request a doctor's letter but your doctor doesn't even have to give them a diagnosis, just confirm what you're capable of and not capable of. 

It's also wise to disclose medication in advance in case you get a false positive on a drug test or maybe you faint at work. 

I've both lied and been honest at jobs and the jobs where I was honest worked out better and most jobs where I lied were a dumpster fire.

I have little to no real friends I actually meet in person and those few I actually ever get to see I only see once a month at a small convention. Asides from them the only friends I have are people I know online, but have never actually seen up until now. I am diagnosed with Asperger's (apparently makes you "incompatible" for social interactions) and ADHD (can't really concentrate on something without some kind of meds and lately those have seemingly stopped working or at least I think they at least don't work as well anymore because my focus problem doesn't seem to be getting better after I take them). I'm one year away from graduation but I'm really thinking about just redoing the last year of school cuz my grades have consistently been sucking for literally all but two subjects in school and those they've actually started to slack in aswell. I can't really make actual friends and I've been a cutter before (1 1/2years ago) but I've stopped because I thought things were getting better. However due to the return of my sister which keeps being an arse me and my lacking social s and bad grades I've recently started to think about cutting myself again because I actually feel that I actually felt better in the time I did it. During really bad nights or after a day that's gone even the slightest bit worse than the average (which for me really isn't a good day compared to normal people's lives) I've also been starting to think about suicide aswell, and those thoughts have started amassing themselves inside my head. Most of the days after school I come home angry that I know I should be getting out and be learning more but I won't because my PC is the only thing that seems to give me some kind of fun at all.

selftext: I dont know where to start. This will go pretty big. Will try to keep as short as possible.

Okay, I am 16 and in first year high school. For years I had no friends. Last year, I went to psychologist and got treatment. Now I feel better and have some "friends". Before, I would be a loner and eat lunch alone. Teachers wont like me when im with my mobile pretending I was just fine.

Now, Since I had a beginning with new people and found some guys. I was diagnosed with level 1 mild asperger syndrome \(No one knows except my parents and some teachers and nurses\) and have social anxiety. Slowly, my friends started to find my weakness and had began to verbally abuse me. They start telling some really bad s\*\*\* to me and block me on social media and all stuff. I was wrong to trust them and reveal that "I never had any friends," and they start using that whenever I have the upper hand.

They are taking advantage of me and I cannot do anything. I talked with the counselor and the psychologist really softly. I cant tell to the teachers since they think we are good friends with one another. My parents cannot really do anything about me. I give respect and yet get known. They literally take all my jokes and humor offensive even if I take theirs freely.

I just have no idea how to have friends and how to talk. I have to return as a loner and be depressed forever. I have great ambitions but really suck with social life. The worst part is I cannot ignore them since I'll meet them everyday at school in the hallway. I dont have any friends outside school and I think it will be the same there. I dont know what to do.

selftext: To start off, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder as well as Social Anxiety Disorder five years ago and I’m on lamictal and lamotrigine. That being said, I feel like my depression is well managed and my anxiety is much better than it was before but I still have panic attacks often despite this(the panic may have even gotten worse).  

These days I feel as though I’m not myself, I’m distant, constantly distracted/spacing out while rarely thinking about anything because my thoughts are so disorganized I can’t follow them. Yesterday I looked in the mirror and I looked like a horrid aged version of myself and I felt disgusted at what I saw. I’m extremely unmotivated, I WANT to go out and do things and be an active participant in my life but my body doesn’t even react when I think of it, or if I do react it usually comes in a panic attack in fear of going outside. I’ve been out of work and on disability for about three months now. When I’m in a situation such as work or school, I feel a crazy amount of uneasiness and tightness in my chest, I can barely breathe, and tears pour. I don’t know what triggers it, but just the thought of going to school or work freaks me out and makes my throat feel like it’s tightening and I become nauseous. I feel like I just have so much shit on my plate and I don’t even know where to start. I don’t even know how to explain all of my feelings in words and it makes me want to tear my hair out. I don’t feel in control of my life or actions and sometimes I feel like im just existing inside the shell of my body and I’m watching shit occur. 

Does anyone have any experiences or can relate and tell me your story?

selftext: So...

I'm a female. 16 years old. I have Aspergers and I was diagnosed at age 12 after I became extremely depressed and suicidal. 

I'm no longer depressed or suicidal, but I sometimes wish that I didn't have Aspergers. I really wish that socializing would come naturally to me. I wish that I could learn when to keep my voice down. I wish that I could temper down the oscillations between being childish and being too adult like. I get happy when I take a walk with my mom \(not normal for a teenager\), I still like watching cartoons, I love getting hugs from my mom, I still sleep with a stuffed animal, I have bedwetting problems.... But I love reading articles, current events, philosophy, psychology, genetics, history, anything. I love learning.

 I wish that I didn't have to constantly act like I am normal. It takes so much mental energy to pretend. 

I wish I had more friends. I have many people that I can make small talk with, but I find it hard to talk about things that really matter to me. 

I have had a strong interest in the medical field ever since I was 4 years old. I have spent hours on my own reading medical journals on the internet and reading any kind of medical textbook that I can find. It sucks that the other people in my high school don't share my interests.

It's a bit more isolating sometimes because I'm a female. Most of the people on the spectrum that I know are males. They can be nice, but I would love to find a fellow female on the spectrum that I could relate to.

The one thing that contradicts this whole set of thoughts and beliefs is the fact that I don't know what I'd do if I was suddenly "cured". I've never lived in a mind that wasn't this one. I don't know whether it would be better or worse.... But a woman can dream.

selftext: I'm not the type of person who'd say "I have depression" when they're clearly just sad and don't have a clinical depression so I'm here to ask you if my symptoms of anxiety are just me worrying too much. 

So I never had a panic attack and I never threw up because I was feeling anxious so whatever is happening to me isn't as severe, but, I have a strong "time anxiety", if I have to go somewhere in 6 hours I will only think about that for every minute of those 6 hours, even tho sometimes I don't actually think about it I still have it in my mind subconsciously, I overthink absolutely everything and I worry too much about every detail(at least about the details that are important to me) I don't really enjoy being in school but I also don't hate it, yet if school starts in 2 hours I will be checking my clock every few minutes to check time and I will get sadder and more anxious the closer it gets for the school to start. When I'm going somewhere I always come 15 minutes early  because I'm anxious about all of the possibilities of me being late even tho I won't be. I appreciate my time so much that I'd legit pee and wash my teeth in the same time so I don't have to waste it doing those 2 thing separately. I don't think I have a "clinical anxiety" BUT WHY do I worry so fucking much?!

-PS : When I was about 9 I used to place things(on the desk,shoes,books) in some kind of an order and when it wasn't like I wanted it would piss me off so much, I went to see a professional and they diagnosed me with "OCD", 1 year later I stopped placing stuff and caring about those things so I guess my "OCD" disappeared ? I don't know if ocd is possible to disappear but ye I'm just curious if it's connected to this.

I have a huge problem and I think you have already noticed it. My weight. Let me start by saying I was diagnosed with IBS a couple of years ago after colonoscopy and I also had gastroscophy done twice. I had a couple stomach erosion spots and that was it, in general everything turned out to be physically okay. But I am not okay. Very far from it. I was always underweight and for months now I have been losing weight. My highest number was 53,6 kilograms/118 pounds. I have been periodically losing weight for 2 years now and today I hit my biggest low. I didn't weight this in college or in high school. Something MUST be wrong, even though I literally heard "that's your nature" from a couple of "doctors". I will add though, that I have depression, social phobia, OCD and I think my mental state is the cause for all of this (I mean the weight loss, not the fact that I always weighted so little). My depression is pretty bad, I have been NEETing for over 2 years now after getting a degree. I have no energy, I sleep a lot, I have problems with getting to sleep and waking up, no motivation, even though I don't work or do anything most of the time I am tired most of the time. What is wrong with me? What should I do? Psychologists never helped me and only took money from me, psychiatrists the same... I feel lost and I really don't know what to do. I am at the brink today and literally want to shoot myself because I am tired with all of this.

I am not on any medications right now. I used to take Duspatalin Retard for my IBS and it helped me for long time but then it worked the other way around and now I'm not taking it anymore.

selftext: I am an 18 year old male, I weigh approximately 270lbs and am not a smoker. I take lorazepam(1mg as needed) and levothyroxine (always switching dosage from 50/75mg 1x/day). I have a previous diagnosis of major depression for which I guess you could say I’m “in remission” from, and I also have been diagnosed with social phobia and hypothyroidism. 

I have been on levothyroxine for a little over a year now and I’m not sure that it is making any difference. When explaining the symptoms of hypothyroidism and the benefits I should expect from the medication, my doctor was extremely vague, giving an answer along the lines of “well it affects many things in the body, including metabolism, anxiety, mood, and many other mental and physical aspects of the body”. Since starting levothyroxine, I’ve noticed no actual difference in any of these areas, only the numbers on my blood test results for the “thyroid hormones” as my doctor calls it. I take my levothyroxine once daily, every day, as soon as I wake up, before food, and only with water. It is rare that I miss a dose and when I do, I generally remember a few hours later and, from what I’ve read, it seems to be safe to take it as soon as you remember as long as it is closer to the time you were supposed to take your dose than it is to the time of your next dose. My blood work always comes back with different numbers for the thyroid hormones, which prompts my doctor to either lower or increase the dosage of levothyroxine, which alternates between 75 and 50mg. Is my doc just a quack, does he not know the proper dosage I need, do I just have a weird thyroid, is this some kind of sign of thyroid cancer?

selftext: Has a book or movie ever been one of your obsessive/special interests?

I've had a lot of special interests in my life. Cats when I was very little, lucid dreams/hypnosis/out\-of\-body experiences/etc when I was 11, religion when I was 12, and when I was a teenager, politics, world religions, and mythology. That's what comes to my mind right now but there's more.

Some of them last for up to a couple years at a time, but my longest obsessive/special interest has lasted for 5 years now: Stephen King's Carrie and all the adaptations. I've thought about it all day every day for the past 5 years. I spend a lot of time watching/reading interviews about it from Stephen King or the cast/directors of the films, &amp; reading analyses about the many layers of symbolism/messages/patterns within the story. In high school I decided to write about its symbolism for an English assignment. I had to condense it to 7 pages but I had 20 pages and counting, and could've written MANY more \(and would've preferred to, if I was allowed to do so\).

I have a folder on my computer with thousands of files about Carrie. I watch every video about Carrie that's posted on YouTube. I dream about Carrie regularly. Carrie feels like part of my soul.

My psychiatrist doesn't even know about my obsession with Carrie, but this past week I was diagnosed with Aspergers, for other reasons. I started doing some research and came across the concept of "special interests", which explains why I've gotten hopelessly obsessed with so many things throughout my life. Including Carrie, I suppose. I came across this person who's had an obsession with Dr Who for 35 years: [http://life\-with\-aspergers.blogspot.com/2007/10/dreaded\-special\-interest.html](http://life-with-aspergers.blogspot.com/2007/10/dreaded-special-interest.html)

Has this ever been the case for any of you? Has a book or movie ever been one of your special interests?

selftext: Heya, I'm one of the many people in the world that's been diagnosed with ADHD, among a few other conundrums in terms of mental health. I used to be on various different medications, including the typical Adderal and Celexa, although roughly around my Sophomore year in Highschool, I had stopped taking most of my medications as they've been causing me a number of self perceived problems. I know that's the doctors tend to be correct and up on their know how when it comes to this type of stuff, but when it comes to lesser known disorders (in my case, Conversion Disorder), I felt like it was inducing anxiety and causing me to have seizure like occurances. For personal reasons, I was taken off of Adderal and put on another ADHD medication which I still can't remember the name of, and that didn't even help at all.

However, after all these years, I can't help but feel I can't maintain any focus on anything anymore, my attention span is fractured to a point that I don't even want to watch a movie with my S/O because I have an unknown anxiety that I just want to read things. That's all I like doing these days, reading broad summaries of things because I can't be bothered to sit down and focus on trying to better myself. I want to be a coder one day. I've tried many different times to learn a code before just dropping it and trying to find something else I wanted to do in the mean time. I feel like I can't think critically enough to be able to formulate a problem. It's like I have all the parts to build what I want to do, but then I don't know how to execute it. If anyone has any idea on how I can help improve my attention span, it'd be greatly appreciated.

selftext: tl;dr: Do any of you feel tired/lethargic all the time? And do your meds help?

So I was diagnosed half a year ago and have been trying different meds since then.
One of my main problems (this has existed for as long as I can remember, before I just thought it was a problem with my sleep) is that I'm almost always feeling tired or lethargic. Doing anything, even the stuff that I like, feels like a chore. It doesn't really matter if I sleep more, but it does get a lot worse if I get less than 5-6 hours of sleep (I guess most people have that problem though).
I've been tested various times for conditions like anemia or hypothyroidism, but nothing seems to be wrong. It was first after I got diagnosed that I began thinking it could be because of ADHD, but I haven't been able to find much info about it.
Haven't really found any meds that deal with this problem yet. Ritalin helps though. Strattera makes it worse, guanfacine makes it worse. Dexedrine doesn't really affect it. Haven't tried Adderal.

My question is, do any of you feel tired or lethargic a lot of the time, and is it because of ADHD?

Yes if there is something that would make me feel good I have to leave it against my will. If I do it like that I can concentrate much better at work and Overall and at the end of the day I feel like I don't really Need it anyway.

I managed to do it like that for a year now just to f\*\*\*\*\* survive the garbage.

.

And somehow god damn out of nowhere Comes that Girl...

The first time I saw her I just looked away because I just know im not Ready for something like that. It's just not me.

I continued going to work and I again just tried to completely ignore her to concentrate on work.

But she kept Looking at me.

I swear I tried to ignore her.

I could only see her once because she was working at a different place. In 3 Days and Every time I walked by I felt like she knew what was going on in me. Like she could f\*\*\*\*\* see Right in my soul.

I tried to look away but why she kept staring at me why???

On the last day I had to work together with her and my mind was going insane. My brain just almost went catatonic, the concentration went away and I kept Fighting with myself.

This is Pretty much what happens when I try to have something valuable in life. Something positive....

But of course I can't.

.

Now 2 Holidays went by and tomorrow I have to work somewhere else.

My biggest fear Right now is that she left her current place to work together with me tomorrow.

I don't know what happens if I ask her out then. It's just it is forbidden for me, by my own mind. I would just feel so guilty having such a beautiful perfect girlfriend. My mind would go insane and if that happens it's the biggest hell on earth that nobody would ever understand.

.

I want to Forget her like everything I had to, but this sh\*\* is so f\*\*\*\*\* different.

.

I don't want to mess her up even tho I think she is a bit messed up what I completely love from her!

.

But if she is gonna be there tomorrow at work together with me, I just have no choice but to ask her to suicide with me.

I wished i understood and gave her the love and attention she needed. She would probably be by my side now if not for my ignorance. I hate myself for this and am living my life now in regret. 
Just happened to watch a schizophrenia stimulation video on youtube and i broke down instantly... If only i knew what she was going through then. If only.
My dream is to become a psychatrist because i want to help and cure those suffering from mental illness, just like how i wish my mom was. But in my country, the competition is really huge and i doubt i can ever enter medicine school. The thought really upsets me :(

selftext: Was just curious if anyone has any experience with inattentive ADHD and/or Concentration Deficit Disorder (CDD)?

As I have been diagnosed ADD my whole life, I know I have more of the inattentive symptoms. As an adult now, that really wants to improve his quality of life and just  get function better, I have been starting to do more research into it all (as opposed to trying to ignore it or blow it off as normal or just accept it). I am just hearing of CDD (literally like a few hours ago) as it was very briefly mentioned by a Dr.Barkley I was listening to (a presentation I am watching on youtube about ADHD). I notice I definitely relate to CDD as well as ADHD.

Is this diagnosed now a days? Treated differently? Anyone have any experience with it (personally or through observation of others, family or friends)?

As always, thanks for being a great community!

Currently I’ve been using Flonase and Claritin D for bad allergies and sinus issues thats pretty much it.

Duration of problem 2 weeks and the white stuff keeps increasing.

Not a smoker or drinker

Only things I’ve been diagnosed with are asthma and GERD

Other symptoms I’ve been having is nausea and a bad headache/upper back pain not sure if this could be linked to this issue.

So, two weeks ago I noticed a little piece of white tissue in my urine and since then it’s been more constant and increasing in numbers. I went to my doctor and they did a UTI test and it came back negative, went to urgent care because I wasn’t feeling well and they did another and that came back negative as well. So I don’t know what to do now or what this could be.

Any kind of help would be appreciated, thank you.

I couldn’t keep up, couldn’t understand my job, couldn’t get organized, made a mess of things, and was fired. Now I need to find another job, but I have no idea how to explain my firing. I want to say that I had an untreated mental illness, have sought treatment, and am now on medication, but I’m not sure about talking about mental illness with potential employers. But if I don’t then it basically looks like I got fired for being too stupid and lazy to do my job. Not a great look.
Has this happened to anyone? How have you handled it? Any advice would be so appreciated.  
  
tl;dr: How do you frame getting fired for ADD/mental illness to perspective employers?

selftext: I’ve been suffering from clinical depression for most of my life and have found that it has taken a pretty serious toll on my focus/concentration. Whereas getting immersed in the storyline of a book, movie or video game was quite easy for me as a kid, I now find it to be a tremendous struggle. It’s particularly bad with reading: I look at the words, maybe start to absorb them a little bit, and then before long I’ve completely zoned out and I have to put the book down. As someone with a love of fiction and escapism, needless to say this is pretty...well, depressing.

I take psych meds, exercise regularly, drink plenty of water and I don’t go to bed late. I’ve never been diagnosed with ADD. Does anyone have any advice for improving focus? I’d really like to finish a movie or a novel sometime without being distracted/dissociated every five seconds.

For literally my entire life, I have CONSTANTLY misplaced things, and when I do find things I lose, I have absolutely ZERO memory of actually leaving the object in that location. On average, I completely lose my iPhone 6 PLUS (so the thing is huge), 5 to 7 times a day, no joke. 

In general I tend to lose the same object multiple times a day. I have a single glove I wear on my right hand whenever I need to put the dog outside because his line is metal, and I don't like the smell of metal on my hand. I lose this glove many times a day as well.

Is this ADHD or something else? I seriously spend 30 minutes to an hour every day looking for things I've just lost.

I'm a 22 years old male with 6 feet  height and 182lbs weight. I live in Brazil and I suffer from a low testorone (180 ng/dL) condition since Aug/2017 (probably earlier but diagnosed in Aug/2017). I've started to notice the shortage of the hormony after recurring erectile disfunction problems with my GF. 

The reasons are unknown. My endocrinologist made me do many exams but none were conclusive. I've done a CT scan from my head, a sonography of my testicles and many many blood tests (6month+ accompaniment). All contributed to nothing since all glandules/blood levels were normal/recommended (excluding testosterone, ofc). My testicule is absolutely normal and has no anomalies.

I've been taking intravenous testosterone applications for around 6 months (21 days intervals) and my T blood levels continue the same, even shortly after injection. 

Anyone know what it could be? Thank you!

It seems as if nearly all the women in my family are diagnosed with both, so I know they’re understanding about it, yet I can’t seem to talk about it with anyone. 
Does anyone else struggle with this? The depression has definitely been worse lately. So much so that it is causing me to be hard to be around. My boyfriend has noticed and it’s affecting (effecting? I never know) our relationship. He doesn’t understand because, again, I can’t seem to talk about it to explain why it’s happening.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can *slowly* start talking about it openly? I want people to know I’m not being like this for the fun of it. I want them to know that I’m struggling and want to be better.

I'm looking for some advice from anyone who may have co\-diagnoses of Aspergers and ADD or has taken ritalin with an aspie brain. Obviously anecdotal evidence isn't always helpful, I'm just trying to get some insights from anyone who may have wisdom from real life experience, rather than the 'clinical' pros and cons \(which I have read a lot of!\).

My 12 year old step\-daughter was diagnosed with Aspergers, social anxiety and ADD three years ago. She is a pretty regular pre\-teen in many regards, but struggles socially, and her easily distracted nature means she is beginning to fall behind in class... and I am conscious that as she gets further behind her mood is slipping along with her dwindling self\-confidence. I wouldn't describe her as a happy kid currently. We are working with her school to find ways to allow her to have quiet time in class, do work that matches her specific interests and practice her social skills... but our GP and the school have both raised the possibility that she might benefit from Ritalin. My concern is that she is already quite anxious, and there are well documented side effects including depression and anxiety. Obviously we can't know if she would experience those side effects until she tries it, but I'm keen to hear from anyone who had similar experiences as a pre\-teen? What worked for you? Did you try medication? Does anyone have any insights that might help? Thanks!

Help im very worried im developing schizophrenia.
u/kohayz
I have schizOCD. I have intrusive thoughts, noises, music, etc (you name it) lately since I've gone on Luvox (I started it about 4 days ago) I've been super jittery, have been having anxiety, can't think clearly, very forgetful (almost like short term memory loss). I just feel disconnected to reality and whenever im trying to type something out it's like I have a hard time piecing words together. At night and when I try to fall asleep sometimes I've been getting that "word salad" stuff in my mind (like random conversations and words just keep connecting to each other) I've been getting less sleep, and having a hard time staying asleep. Today I was at a car dealership waiting to have my car fixed and I kept thinking "what if that guy is talking about me" - is this a hallucination? Then I was like "what if im hallucinating" and I got a panic attack. I always read stuff online about mental illness and Schizophrenia, I freak myself out and start worrying and start thinking im hallucinating. It's gotten to the point where I start mistaking inanimate as people or think their moving and then when I notice them even closer I realize it's just normal stuff. It's like every sort of stimulus in my vision or hearing sets me off.. I have this thing called visual snow also which really makes it hard for me to see clearly at night and I see static vision. Is this another sign of Schizophrenia? I talk to myself and and repeat old conversations and things I've said before.. almost like random memories.. I heard that's a sign of Schizophrenia? My erp therapist told me that im not schizophrenic but I just keep having doubts and my fear won't go away... Whenever I see or read stuff about people who are in a schizophrenic episode I start thinking "what if that's me"... "What if that happens to me" and then when I have a panic attack I can't think at all... Help guys o really am worried im going crazy and I need some input.

My best friend set me straight. Got back on my meds, and am now deciding to trust my good friends and mental health team. I'm going to try hard to believe them because I want to be happy, and I can't be happy constantly thinking I have to kill myself for my voices. So I struggle every day with ignoring them. With believing in my brain's faulty wiring and my mental illness.

It's incredibly difficult, but necessary. I gotta do this so I can enjoy my life and no longer suffer.

selftext: Since the age of 15 iv'e not been "right" and always had something wrong with me. Iv'e never really been able to say I am happy for a substantial amount of time and since entering the work force things have got 10x worse. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder which I feel was a curse rather than a blessing diagnoses.

Right now I am sitting in my office at work looking around questioning why people do what to do and how they do it. They are successful people who go home to families, go to events after work and talk about their adventures and financially free. They're always laughing and smiling.
They seem functional and completely different to me like they're a different breed. All I can do is think about quitting my job and giving up on everything, I do very little work and hope they fire me so I can go home. No one talks to me because I can't hold conversations with them and couldn't care about them even if I tried.

I am unable to pick up a direction in life, I tried to do a career change and got an entry level position which lasted 4 months as I buckled under the pressure. I started to manipulate my medication and drugs to trigger manic episodes in a vain attempt to feel happy. I'm slightly below average intelligence and can't accept that low skill work is all I am destined for and at the same time I can't accept that I am going to struggle financially the rest of my life.
The depression is putting a strain on my relationship. Every time I come to work I have a existential crisis and my girlfriend has to listen to my melt downs over WhatsApp and she's getting pretty tired of it.

I don't want to live like this but I have no idea what to do. 
I want a career, a life and be happy. I want to go do things, people said getting a job would make my life better but it's made it 10x worse. Studying in my free time would lead me to better job prospects but all it does is make me tired... I am 28 and feel worse than I did at 15. Depression doesn't get any better, we just suffer worse and worse.

selftext: I know it might seem like a pretentious thing to say, but it's true. I hate being an Aspie (for those who don't know, that's a slang term for someone with Aspergers) and I wish I was a neurotypical. Not only are there many aspects of socialising that I just don't understand, but there are many things that I struggle with or simply cannot do just because I'm on the milder end of the autism spectrum, which either make me out to be a laughing stock or an object of patronisation to many neurotypicals. It's like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. (I'm not saying all neurotypicals are like this, just that many neurotypicals I encounter react to Aspies such as myself in these ways.)

For example, sometimes when I'm talking to someone, I tend to overthink what I'm about to say next (yes, even if it's just small talk), which makes me start stuttering or making long pauses. This can cause either one of these two reactions: the person I'm talking to starts sniggering at me, or the person I'm talking to takes pity on me and tries to finish my sentences whilst giving me a puppy-dog-eyed look. Both of these reactions make me feel like I'm some kind of animal in a zoo being gawked at.

The thing that makes it worse is that many neurotypicals invalidate the struggles of many Aspies such as myself just because we're "not autistic enough". I've had people who've accused me of self-diagnosing just because I didn't seem autistic enough (for the record, I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist when I was 4 years old). On the opposite end of the spectrum, I've also had people imply to me that I'm "not autistic enough" in a patronising way by telling me that I don't "look" autistic. (What do they expect autistic people to look like? Should I have green skin and devil horns or something?)

I'm sorry if nothing I'm saying makes sense, I'm just ranting on a lot of stuff that's been on my mind. I may be overthinking things, but that's just how I've interpreted it based on my own experiences and the experiences of other Aspies I know. Again, I'm not saying that all neurotypicals are like this and if I've offended any of you, I apologise, as that was not my intent.

For 27 yrs I was heavy into drugs and alcohol so my counselor says that it helped keep it controlled. It still popped up put not like now. Ive been clean and sober for 3yrs and the emotions/suicidal thoughts/ mood up and downs so often/ everything is very difficult. The worse right now is the lose of my FP. I had a FP, even though I didnt know that was what it was thought it was a normal friendship, for about 2.5 yrs which is the longest friendship ive ever had. Then, looking back now, my fear of abandonment cause the friendship to end. Which was fine cause I was getting romantically close with another person and it just switched to her. Then in my norm it was a bright powerful relationship that I ruined in a little over 2 months. All the normal things needy, clingy, needing to be around her all the time, focusing all my energy on her. It understandably became to much for her so she pulled away some and we got in a big argument and that was the end of that. That was 3 weeks ago so im still feeling such intense pain over it. Plus she was the 1st person i ever felt 100&amp;#37; safe around and when she held me or we cuddled it was moments of perfection. Ive never felt such feelings. so now Im trying to come to terms with the diagnoses and not having a FP. without my FP I feel lost, like something is missing, extremely depressed more often, afraid to be at social events cause they're not there to help me get through it, plus whats the point in going if they're not there. I feel empty. I haven't really left my place in 3 weeks except for work and a couple recovery meetings. I feel the need to find another but I dont want to put another person through that. I have one friend still in my life and I can see it starting to form. Im torn cause I feel the need for it but what if I hurt her also. I dont want to hurt another person just so I can be happy. But she's also the only real support I have right now in dealing with this and what it means for the rest of my life. Other then my counselor of course. But if I keep letting her in I dont know if I'll be able to stop it.

selftext: I posted a few times earlier in the year about my struggles and I ended up paying to see a Psychiatrist, and it is perhaps the best money I have ever spent. They were extremely helpful in making me understand the process, and went through all the relevant questions - reports from colleagues and family and so on. I was doubting myself, I was paranoid I’d invented the fact I had ADHD and was making excuses for myself instead.

They were reluctant to diagnose before other potential causes were ruled out so I had my vitals and bloods checked by my GP, nothing untoward was found and I had a follow up appointment.

I got diagnosed which in itself was a huge relief, the report was excellent and went into detail about the reasoning for the diagnosis and how it impacted my life.

I started on Concerta XL 18mg a week ago and it has, without exception been the best week of my entire life. I’m 31 now and obviously wish I’d been diagnosed earlier in life as it’s a long time to think ill of yourself and the efforts you put in.

I’ve been listening to the audiobook ‘Taking Charge of Adult ADHD’ and have learned so much about my diagnosis since, and how best to try to cope whilst on medication.

I feel relieved that I wasn’t ‘making it up’ and urge anyone in a similar position to seek treatment. I cried the other day because of how happy I have been in this last week. Stuff that felt difficult before no longer does, things make sense.

My personal analogy so far, is life up to this point was like a dot to dot without numbers, I knew I had to connect the dots but had no idea as to the order, and nothing made sense. For the last week, it’s as if the numbers have started to appear and things make much more sense, I’ve got more done in the last week than in the last five weeks.

I do have one question for any of you who may have read this far... I am due to titrate up to 36mg next week, I’m somewhat excited and perhaps a little scared that it may be possible to feel even better than I do now, what are your experiences with this?

I love life, for the first time in my life.

selftext: My sister was diagnosed a few years ago. She’s been rapid cycling the last two months and going from feeling on top of the world, to suicidal, to “crazy” and out of control over the course of weeks and sometimes days. 

I have a baby, a full time job, and I’m exhausted, but I feel like if I’m not available when she calls... I just don’t know where to draw the line on boundaries. If she harms herself after I muted her phone call, how do I forgive myself? 

I don’t know where to draw healthy boundaries with her. When I take a step back and let her know I have other things to take care of (like just talking once a day for a few days), she often ends up spiraling into depression. She’s in therapy and on meds. She recently changed medication and I think that’s part of the issue right now. She’s working with her psychiatrist to get them adjusted correctly. 

I’ve been thinking about going to therapy myself, so I have some support too.

selftext: I hit a wave of something, I don’t know exactly, and I have recovered from it but my grades have gone down the drain. I was a straight A student the last few years taking the most advanced courses available and recently my uncle was diagnosed with cancer and given a very short amount of time to live which hit me very hard. I’m also forced to watch my 5 year old sister for multiple hours a night until 10 or 11 pm sometimes, or if I have an activity after school like math honors society I have to walk 5 miles home and don’t get home until very late, and I simply cannot focus on things for school until then. I think I’m going to end up getting 3 B’s this semester and I’m planning on loading up with 8 AP classes the next 2 years. Will this be enough with straight A’s the next couple of years to get me into a top university?

selftext: I've recently been diagnosed with BPD, which has come as sort of a shock to me and my girlfriend; it was not entirely unexpected, but a shock nonetheless. I've been struggling with dealing with all of my emotional ups and downs, and my girlfriend has her own mental health issues going on that cause her to be emotionally unstable as well - suffice it to say, we have been feeding off of each other's emotionality. She does not have BPD, and I do not have what she has, so it's been hard for her to relate to what's been going on with me, and vice versa. 

I don't have any friends who have BPD (as far as I know), and I haven't told many people what's going on with me. I've also tried reaching out to a few other subreddits to try to find some friends to talk about anything and everything with, but I haven't had much luck. I figured a good place to go to find someone I could relate to would be this subreddit. I figured there would be someone on here who's sort of in the same boat as me, so this is me shooting my shot :)

selftext: A few days ago I went to a psychiatrist for the first time for my anxiety. He prescribed me 10mg Trintellix, and 2 2mg a day of Klonopin. He also gave me 18.8mg of Adzenys to work in adjunct to the Trintellix, and because I work shift work. I’ve never been diagnosed as ADHD, and never really felt like I’ve had it. I didn’t realize what it was until I picked the script up. I’m honestly terrified to even try it since from what I’ve read that seems to be a rather high dose. I guess I’m looking for some advice on what I should do/ what to expect. I’m scared it’s going to be too intense for me since it’s the equivalent to 30mg Adderall XR. I have once in college taken an Adderall recreationally and I absolutely hated it. I felt trapped in my own body. Though I don’t know what mg that was, and I was also drinking alcohol with it.  I haven’t taken any at all yet because I’m so nervous about it. Any advice would be much appreciated!

selftext: My dad was diagnosed with Stage 3 prostate cancer in November.

My brother attempted suicide the week of my father's surgery. He was in a medically induced coma for a few days from OD'ing.

Yesterday, my mom died unexpectedly on Mother's Day. She aspirated on fluid and suffocated to death in her sleep. I called her the morning of to make plans and she never picked up.

My boyfriend of 2 years and I work with children. A few days ago he admitted that when he was younger and addicted to several drugs he watched child porn of young tween girls. I've seen google searches as recent as a year ago for non-porn NSFW pictures of teens. Tonight I found deleted pictures of a 10 year girl we work with's panties that he had secretly taken while she had her legs crossed at a table in our youth center.

I feel so numb that I don't know what to do other than just list the facts as they are. I can't even cry anymore.

selftext: I was at a psychosis group and they were talking about how kanye west had gone through psychosis. 

Does anyone here have an opinion on him? Love him? Hate him? Don't care? 

I've had a long relationship with him as a public figure, I loved his music and he had his breakdown around the time I did so he became more emotionally important to me as it made me feel less alone. I feel really upset now that I hear he isn't in therapy or taking his medication. A lot o what he talks about reminds me of me when I was going through my psychosis, grandious delusions, love everyone, paranoid distrust of established authority. I'm not going to diagnose him but I feel I get him more than the ordinary population and I see him as more ill than the ordinary population because they haven't really got the empathy and sort of see him as a circus clown.

Does anyone else have any opinions or thoughts. I feel very lonely with my point of view in the hip hop and kanye subreddit.

selftext: 25F here  - brief background about myself: I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and MDD. But I’ve been trying to work very hard on myself.

My friend invited me and two other acquaintances (her friends I met before) to celebrate her birthday this weekend. Now suddenly she’s having them bring their friends who she met. I’m feeling a little uncomfortable because I really only know her. However, for MY birthday night out she didn’t express concern or back out when I invited her, and I had a bunch of people she didn’t know come. But I had made a strong effort to make sure everyone introduced themselves and talking to someone.

I told my therapist about this. She asked me what the worst thing that could happen, and I said I probably would feel left out and leave early.

Perhaps it’s my stupid anxiety talking. Shall I just give it the benefit of the doubt and just go? I thought I’d invite another friend who could keep me in company just in case, but that would be a little disrespectful.

selftext: It’s been a while since I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. 

My treatments have been helpful but last year I went a little overboard with alcohol (because I wanted to “feel” something) and attempted two suicides in a row. 

I thought I was ok but sometimes I’m overwhelmed with my loneliness and taking so much pills to live when I actually don’t want to live. 

I travelled across the country to maybe try living in a different environment and feel free from my regular responsibilities as a wife, mom and daughter. So far it’s been great, so great that I thought how nice it would be to end my life here than go back to home. 

I love and embrace my loneliness but I am afraid of these thoughts and how desperate I am to stop existing. I wish things were different. I wish I wasn’t so sick all the time. I wish I was stronger. I wish so many things right now.

selftext: So... we were together only for six months and said son was an accident. Son was born with no kidneys, now on a transplant. At first his dad was commited, but when son was five (and diagnosed with autism) he un-commited. He owns thousands of dollars in child support and today I found out he left his known address and apparently moved to the US (we live in south america). 

F*ck you, I really hope karma is real and you get what you deserve: to die alone and on dialysis. I know I shouldn't wish him ill, it's just, we have been through so much and this pathetic excuse of a human being is now living with no responsibilities, no emotional pain, no worries on kidneys going into failure. F*ck you so much, I wish you all the pain your son has endured, back at you.
Púdrete en el infierno @&amp;$#%(?$&amp;!!! *redacted to be able to post


Thanks for letting me vent.

selftext: I'm 25, I'm diagnosed with ADHD and asperger.
Actually I'm no more socially isolated and I work for a catering agency but I got this job because of my family knew the CEO's.
BTW it is really small/familiar activity and I know I can't to this for the rest of my life. I have pretty much no hours ( I worked for 24 hours with no rest, believe me ) and work is basically is physically hard.
Also I don't have visual and short term memory...

I don't really know what to do, I'm thinking about applying for some other job like Nursing Aide but I really have no ideas.
I'm not rich at all, I don't know if I can do UNI because I always had bad grades at school and like I said before...no memory at all.
I don't know what to do, I feel too old for UNI here in Europe...also there are only low income JOBs in Italy.

Sorry for my broken english but I'm italian.

selftext: Seriously, since I was like 9 I've always been of a depressive nature, and the suicidal thoughts just got harder and harder. Right now I'm 16 and :

* I have very few friends which I'm pretty sure bad mouth me behind my back
* I feel like the laughing stock of the fucking world \(Not the world, but the people who know me\)
* I have just been diagnosed with a disease which will not be mentioned here but will give me it's share of restrictions in various ways
* My parents are super overprotective, they're always gowing through my things and forbid me to do things \(They even forbid me from studying what I want/pursuit my dreams\)
* I've grown less and less outgoing with time, right now I seem to have developed social anxiety
* I feel like I haven't much to live for

AND I can't even grow a pair of balls to kill myself, idk what am I scared of, oh well.

selftext: Hi everyone. I'm diagnosed with BPD. 

 I'm in a long term relationship and fairly happy. But the honeymoon phase is long over. We live together and have a stable life. The thing is, sometimes I feel like I need attention from my SO. I do know he loves me, but sometimes I feel like just knowing doesn't cut it.

On one hand, I hate asking for attention. I believe that if I ask for attention straight forward and if he gives it, it won't feel real. Also there's the fact that he has other things to worry about, like his job. I don't want him to stress over our relationship. And it sounds selfish to say "hey gimme attention".  On the other hand, I kind of feel dead recently. I hate this and feel guilty even typing this but I kind of miss flirting. Any kind of excitement or passion. 

What is the healthy way to deal with this? I have literally no idea. It would be great to hear your opinions. Thanks.

selftext: 28(F), 5'6, 133 lbs. I just got diagnosed with PCOS (lean phenotype with normal androgens and normal blood sugar &amp; hemoglobin A1c). In my lab results, my endocrinologist noted that I have high total iron levels (228 mcg/dL with ref range of 40-190 mcg/dL) and high iron saturation (91% with ref range of 11-50%). That said, I have a normal iron binding capacity level (250 mcg/dL with ref range of 250 - 450 mcg/dL) and normal ferritin (122 ng/mL with ref range of 10-154 ng/mL). There is a possibility that I have hemochromatosis (my maternal grandfather had it, but my mother cannot have it because her mother was tested and is not a carrier), but my endo said that I would likely have higher ferritin levels in that case. I've been doing some research on my own, and can't find any reasons why I would have high total iron and saturation but normal ferritin and normal TIBC, other than iron supplements. The only supplements I take are prenatal vitamins (I'm trying to conceive) that DO NOT have iron in them.

I do not smoke, and I currently take no oral medications. I take Restasis eye drops for chronic dry eye and clotrimazole betamethasone cream topically for occasional yeast infections. As I mentioned above, I have diagnosed PCOS, and I also have IBS that is currently relatively well controlled by diet.

selftext: I had just finished my exams and barely survived the ordeal. So the first thing I decided to do was to get checked up for my anxiety issues and the lack of focus... I had suspected that I may have ADHD and wanted to get checked.

I was the last patient.

I tell the doctor I’ve had multiple panic attacks in the past month, and he refers me to the psychologist for a consultation. While describing my panic attacks of breathlessness and how I zoned out and lost control, he would give me weird faces as though i was lying about them being panic attacks. 

Since I wanted to check for ADHD, I asked him nicely whether the psychologist would be able to diagnose whether I had ADHD, he briefly just shrugged it off to say “oh actually this Issue of focusing is completely natural, everyone of us has it; the psychologist wouldn’t be able to diagnose it for you; because it’s something you have to dig deep to find motivation and fix it yourself. Even I have focus issues myself” whenever I would indicate I have serious physical inability to control my impulses of using my phone or doing other things... he would say that’s normal.

I lost it there. Years of training reduced to that one moment where he just wanted to go home and just be an overall douche. It’s not that I insisted on having ADHD, I just wanted to get checked; and even that was too hard for him.

TL;DR: doctor annoyed me when he says everyone has focus issues, not unique to me. Go home and find some motivation for yourself.
