selftext: This is a personal reminder, but also a way to participate on this reddit which I sometimes read in the past whenever I wanted to quit. 

I'm 26, my first cig was when I was 12, my grand-parents and parents are all smokers, including most uncles and aunts. I was smoking nearly a pack a day (about 15-20 a day, sometimes more if I drank alcohol). I'm also asthmatic.

The longest I quit was 1 month, but then I went to see my family (I've been living a little far away from them now) and when I saw everyone smoking in the house, smelling cigarettes, seeing cigarettes everywhere, I could not resist, I had a weakness. I told myself "just one or two...". Then "just while i'm staying here" and then it was too late, I went back to smoking nearly a pack a day. 

Reaons for quiting again : caughing muccus every morning which makes me gag and want to vomit everytime. Being out of breath with the smallest exercices, i'm going to travel 2 weeks and doing alot of hiking and I want to be in better shape for it, I'm going on a date with a very smart, nice and beautiful girl who is also very healthy and I want to do activities with her, and I do not want to be a slave to nicotine anymore.

It's 1 A.M at my place right now, i'm working at 8:30 A.M and I can't sleep, i'm craving for a cigarette. But i'm going to stay strong.

selftext: I'm into week 2 and REALLY struggling with a huge crave. It's been building the last couple days and today it's almost unbearable.

I just can't stop thinking about just going, getting a pack, smoking 1 and then restarting the stop.

Now logically I know this is BS and just my mind telling me to give in, and the cycle begins again.

However, right now I just can't cope. Does having a nicotine mint reset my quit counter? Would this make me more likely to start smoking again as I'm putting more nicotine back into my body?

selftext: Hey, everyone. I’m on day 4 of my quit and I have been using a low nicotine vape as a bit of a crutch to help with me getting through this. (2 pack a day smoker) 
I’m sure most of you have experienced the coughing and hacking up of mucus and all sorts of goodness from your chest throughout your time smoking.
I’m still experiencing this lightly and I’m curious if I should blame the vape or is this just residual effects from my smoking as I’ve only been off the cigs for 4 days.

selftext: 10 year smoker here, I quit again 4 days ago and it's never gone this well before. For the first time in my life, I'm certain I can do this. I've tried to quit in a serious way 4 times, but in the back of my mind I always knew I hadn't smoked my last cigarette. No matter how much I hated my habit. The thing I loathe the most about smoking is waking up to my stinky cigarette hand next to my face on my pillow after a long night of drinking. Absolutely the most disgusting thing on this planet. Drinking has always been my downfall with cigarettes. I lose all sense of willpower, and wake up with a horrible nicotine hangover every time. 

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to quit cold turkey and lasted about a month and before I began sneaking cigs on my nights out. I tried the patch because I heard it would put so much nicotine in my system that smoking would make me sick. It just gave me panic attacks and heart palpitations. I tried gum. I hated the spicy burn it had, and I often still wanted a cigarette an hour later when the gum buzz wore off. I tried vaping and it was expensive, leaky, dorky looking, a pain in the ass to keep charged, and just didn't give me that back of the throat hit I craved. Often I would find myself more addicted to nicotine than with my usual smoking habit, and went back to my American spirits with a furious apatite, smoking twice what I used to for a month or so.

&amp;nbsp;

The thing that finally changed for me, and it feels like cheating, is I found something I like even more than cigarettes. Something even more addictive and satisfying, and it scares me a little. I got a Juul.

&amp;nbsp;

It hits the back of my throat and my brain in a way no other vape ever has. In a way only that first smoke of the day can. Two hits and I'm swimming in an instant delicious nicotine head rush. It charges so fast (under an hour), doesn't have a bunch of parts to maintain, and warns me when it's running low on battery so it doesn't crap out on me at the bar. The battery lasts exactly as long as one pod so it takes the most minimal effort to keep it running. It hits perfectly every time and tastes amazing. I can use it almost anywhere because it is so small and discrete and the smell doesn't hang in the air. I don't feel self conscious using it in public. And it might be cheaper than my smoking habit, though we'll see. I'm obsessed with this thing. But I also feel like it has me hooked on nicotine on a whole new level. And I'm a little scared. 

&amp;nbsp;

It only took me 3 days to go through a pod, and one pod is supposed to be equivalent to a whole pack of cigarettes. I was rarely more than a pack a week smoker, unless I was having a serious party weekend, and most of those were bummed out to friends. I find myself wanting to hit it all the time. But I haven't wanted a cigarette even once. Not last night when I was drinking red wine with a bunch of my smoker roommates on the porch. Not this morning with my cup of coffee. Not after the big greasy burger I had for lunch. Not during my long drive home from work. Not while I was doing my homework on a heavy dose of Adderall. Not when I was feeling kinda gassy crampy and constipated and needed a little help taking a nice big shit. My Juul has me covered. 

&amp;nbsp;

I love it. I love it so much it worries me. They don't make lower concentration pods, and they definitely don't make nicotine free pods. Their juice contains nicotine salts instead of freebase nicotine like most e liquids, and this shit is like crack. Whoever created Juul knows what they are doing. I am subscribed to their monthly delivery of pods and completely beholden to them. But at least I'm not smoking. So long as I have this thing in my pocket, I know I won't ever smoke another cigarette again. I've never felt this certain I was done in my life. I guess I should be happy, but moving on to what feels like a much stronger addiction was not what I had in mind...

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: I got a Juul and finally found something I like more than cigarettes. Too bad it is it's crazy addictive and I've tripled my nicotine intake.

selftext: I have read tons of online material about preparing, have taken the steps a few times in the past, but the only thing I've left out previously is letting people know my intentions. Each and every time I have set a date in the past year or so, it's been too easy to put it off, simply because of this step. 

This time I'm announcing it (have already told a few people, got a currently smoking quit buddy, and a wealth of advice from an ex smoker who's also helping). 

Additionally...I've rid my space of ashtrays, any old packs, anything associated with smoking, and am destroying my last pack before I go to bed tonight. I've got a list of what to do in the event of triggers, and have some tea tree/mint toothpicks, along with some carrot sticks, for the first week or two. 

No nicotine replacement - tried a few different ones, did not like them. Plus, I want to just get the nicotine out of my system and move on from smoking. 

Any advice for how to hang in there for the first day, three days, week?

selftext: (Sorry in advance for the rambling and any formatting issues. I'm finding that writing this stuff down helps me figure out ways to help myself, and if I'm honest, internet stranger support is pretty swell too.)

I've haven't had a cigarette for 6 days, though I've had two puffs of my boyfriend's 3 days ago. The vape is the only reason I haven't gone and bought a pack. I started at 6mg for the nicotine, and it has been the perfect amount to shut my brain up when I get cravings. It also helps with the hand to mouth feeling that is a major part of my addiction, so on my break I go out to vape because I don't know what to do on breaks besides smoke. 

Today I forgot it and was so upset and didn't know what I was going to do on my break, or how grumpy I was going to be, but I told myself I wasn't going to bum one. I even told the other smokers as soon as I realized to not give me one if I asked. 

First half of my break I went to the Tim Hortons near my work and then to the bathroom, and didn't get any major cravings. So that was good. Second half of my break I went and stood outside for a bit, and took another bathroom break to avoid being too bored (which triggers cravings real bad for me), and I made it through that without major anger. It helped that my coworkers are amazingly supportive, and even some customers who heard I was quitting were super supportive.

The biggest test for me was busing home. Having nothing else to do makes me crave a smoke something awful, so waiting for the bus and walking places is when a lot of my smoking would happen. I discovered that listening to music with a really heavy bassline to it helps, because the tapping of my foot gave me something to focus on.

I'm so pleased with myself, I managed to go without nicotine for a long ass time by my standards, and I didn't immediately run for my vape when I got home!

I honestly didn't think I'd be able to make it this far, yet here I am. If I can do it, anyone can!

selftext: I’m 19 years old and no one knows I smoke. I smoke around 5-6 cigarettes a day in private, not letting anyone see me. I feel awful about this I’m ashamed that I’m a smoker and I feel if I tell anyone now they’ll never forgive me for withholding the truth for so long. I am constantly at war with myself. I have admitted it to no one but myself, but I am a smoker. I’ve been smoking for two years and have said “this is my last pack” and made a feeble attempt at quitting more times than I can count. I struggle because no one knows about my dirty habit, so I am free from any external judgement if I go pick up a pack and smoke them - which is making cravings very hard. I know I am an awful person for the way I handled my smoking. This is the longest I’ve gone in a long time and my most successful attempt as quitting; I just passed the 48 hour mark. 

I’m having a hard time and need the support, so I felt the need to write something somewhere.

selftext: I'm 22.  Figure now's the right time to stop. Started a few years ago casually. As a 'social smoker'. Eventually started buying my own packs, smoking alone and at this point I suck down 4 to 6 a day.  Sometimes to deal with stress, sometimes from habit, sometimes just cause I'm already outside so may as well.  I've definitely consistently owned a pack of cigs for a year now.  
I tried cold turkey a few months back and couldn't do it.  I went through two rough days and a sweaty, shivering, sleepless night but I cracked at the end of day two.    

I'm trying something new this time.  I got a cheap vape and medium level nicotine juice.  Gonna work that for a week and switch to lower nicotine.  After that I'll switch to zero-nicotine juice and just hit the thing for taste--I figure that might make it easier.  

I gotta do this now.  I've just finished college and got a few weeks before I start work and being a 'real adult'. I'm young but I've already felt the side effects...being winded after a flight of stairs, feeling short of breath etc.  I've got some low-stress weeks coming up so there's no better time on the horizon.  I got my vape to keep it easy and have been careful not to hit it like crazy and I got a plan to cut down.  
Back when I first started smoking the lie I told myself was that it was fine cause I was young.  Just being a dumb kid.  Well, here I am about to enter the real world so it's now or never.  I'm done.  I'm done denying that I'm somehow not addicted.  I'm done caving to the pressure. I'm done lying to myself I could quit any time. 

I've been off cigs for two days now, using my vape to curb the cravings when I start going nuts.  It's been bad at times but no where near as bad as cold turkey.  I got this. Small steps.  

Thanks for reading if you've read this far. Just figured I'd share.  I got friends supporting me but none of them smoke so it's not the same.  If anyone's got tips on how not to get hooked on the vape I wouldn't mind hearing those either I guess.

selftext: This Sub is the absolute bee's knees Y'all. I am super grateful. I discovered it last week when I decided in the moment to quit again. I was an off and on again smoker for about ten years, alternating between a pack a day to a pack a week to vaping to smoking black 'n milds when I thought it would be okay. They are fucking gross. It all stinks, and vaping increases your douchiness by a full degree of magnitude. 

I come here sometimes to ride out a craving. Also, been doing sets of 12-20 pushups or jumping jacks to help with dopamine. Today I actually feel productive at work and able to focus. 

I am not a smoker, and you all helped me reach that. Thank you!!!

selftext: Hi all, this is my first post here (though I’ve been lurking for a couple of days)


I decided to try and quit again. Long story short, I quit smoking cigarettes back in around about October 2017. I switched to vaping and eventually quit that altogether too.


Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago and I’m currently staying with my partner and his family (We’re in a long distance relationship) and I hadn’t touched a cigarette since I quit. Problem is, his family are smokers, so the cravings became really strong and I gave in and bought a pack. A few days later I came clean to my partner about it knowing he’d be (understandably) disappointed. But he handled it well, said everyone makes mistakes, and we came to an agreement that I could smoke until his parents come back from their mini-break (3 days in the Netherlands) then I gotta pack it in for good. I agreed and promised that I would. 


On the day they return I kept my word and gave what was left of my pack to my partners older brother &amp; that was that. 


I haven’t gave in again yet but the cravings are becoming stronger and stronger and I don’t know how best to deal with them without resorting to vaping/other products, but I know that if I go onto anything else I’ll crave the real thing again so I’m kinda just going cold turkey. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks for reading

selftext: Im six months smoke free after a 15 year pack a day addiction.  Overall feeling a lot better, cravings are still there but they are manageable.  I'm still having trouble with long term exercising and have gotten "smokers flu"/chest cold a couple times, most recently this week.  Any one else experience this? I thought that six months clean, I shouldn't be experiencing "smokers flu" this far into quitting.  And wondering for those who exercise, how long it took to build your wind/endurance back up.  Many thanks!

selftext: I know this is a newb question, but I need that kick up the ass to stick to vaping. I smoke about 5 packs a week. About 8 packs if I was drinking (quit drinking for good because of gallbladder removal). 

I'm getting 20 mg nicotine salts tomorrow because even 12mg has had a huge impact on cravings. I had four cigarettes today because walking around the town for hours and taking photos is how I keep active. I'm easily clocking 8 miles a day so I've always justified the smoking with cognitive dissonance by saying at least I was getting exercise. If I didn't have enough money for smokes I wouldn't even bother walking around that much tbh... 

I want kids and a long life. I look young for my age right now and don't have any wrinkles + my parents have aged well. I put sun factor 50 screen on everyday and moisturise every night but still smoke?? I already have asthma and have gotten pneumonia three times in the past 2 years. 

Is 8 years too much damage to bounce back from?

selftext: First of all, I want to say thank you to the people who took some of their time to encourage me, even if it were just a few words. Also, good job for the words of encouragement you also give to other people!

I wanted to share some thoughts I had, if it can help anyone or have some positive effect, then mission accomplished!

-First : I quit cold turkey and had no date or time planned. I did that in the past and always failed except for once for 1 month, then I fked up and smoke again. What's different this time? After the 3rd day, i'm not craving a cig anymore, i'm not fighting an impulse, not having a debate between two voices in my head (one saying smoke and the other saying quit).

-2 : I think i'm not craving anymore because I had a big realisation : most of the cigarettes I smoked were not only not enjoyed, but I smoked them out of habit. These last few months I really started to hate smoking, everything about it. When I bought my last pack, I enjoyed my first cigarette because I tried and fail to quit. But I swear to god, the 24 cigarettes after were out of habit and not in relation to a craving or even a strong desire to smoke : the first cig of the morning, the cig after eating, the ones on my breaks at the job, the one after the job and during the ride back to my place, and the one before going to bed. After I realised this, I felt even more disgust with smoking and my weaknesses.

-3 : after the 2nd day, no more cravings because I changed my mindset. I'm not sacrificing something when I stop smoking. Because I realised that I mainly smoked out of habit, it did not feel so hard to resist that few seconds of wanting nicotine. It's the opposite : I'm making sacrifices WHEN I'M SMOKING. Sacrificing my health, my money, my time, my freedom, my attractiveness. 

I hope these things were at least interesting to read for some of you. Stay strong everyone, we can do it!

selftext: Maybe I am addicted and I don't want to belittle anyone's struggle. I'm a casual smoker. Not a social smoker but a casual smoker. The reason I started smoking was because my first high school job as a dishwasher you got "smoke breaks" on top of your regular breaks if you were a smoker. I kept up the habit. But I only smoke at work and while driving. I think it's a boredom thing. If I'm home for the weekend I won't smoke at all or if I'm with friends or family I never need to go for a smoke. Just smoking at work and driving I smoke about 2-3 packs a week and winter I smoke 2-3 packs a month.

I think it would be easy to quit. It's unhealthy and its a waste of money. But at the same time I can't imagine what to do on work breaks or what I would do while driving. A big part of not wanting to quit if it's just almost a part of my idenity now. Anyone quit who was just a casual smoker but struggled to quit? What helped you?

And I am now eating more to replace my habit. Is there a non nicotine alternative like an e -cig of some sort that I can just puff on but doesn’t have all the yucky stuff in it?

selftext: This is a long post anyone who has used NRT aids at all id appreciate your advice. All the info I find is from the companies that make them and it seems like they want you to use them as long as possible and theyre quite expensive.

Been just under a pack a day going on 10 years with no real attempts to quit. I have switched to some fancy ‘additive free’ roll your own smoke for the last month it attempt to ween myself off. 

Doing the math I was smoking 15 a day with each cigarette being .8g of tobacco. The roll your own pouches are 50g of tobacco and one lasts we two weeks roughly. For the cigarettes it was 15 a day x 14 days = 210 smokes in 2 weeks. 210 x . 8 = 168g of tobacco in two weeks / 14 is 12g of tobacco a day.

For roll your own its 50g / 14 days = 3.5g of tobacco a day. So I am smoking a third of the tobacco I was presently and havent noticed any major negative feelings. I have read you get 1mg of nicotine per cigarette meaning I was getting 15mg a day previously and 4mg a day this last month roughly.

Based on this I bought my NRT aids. I see they are in 3 steps 21mg 14mg and 7mg over 24hr. Smokers over 10 a day do 21mg and under 10 do 14mg. Tapering down to 7mg eventually. So with this in mind I only bought step 3 which is 7mg over 24hr as ive only been smoking the equivalent of 3-4 smokes a day. 

Ideally id cold turkey but its just not something I can deal with now. However I do not want to be on any prolonged NRT. So I bought a pack of 7mg patches and 2mg gums. I feel going on the 14mg over 24hr patch would be increasing my nicotine intake which defeats the point.

 Basically my plan is 1 week of 7mg patches then chew a couple pieces  of 2mg gum a day for 4mg nic a day then down to one piece 2mg a day then no gum. I have experience with addiction and im treating this one with the same quick taper mindset.

So basically im wondering if I am totally naive and uninformed as to how NRT works and my plan. I know its going to take more than just NRT and getting off nicotine to quit for good but I just need help with the nicotine withdrawal aspect.

Either way tomorrow morning I will be putting that first 7mg patch on and hoping I can kick this nasty wasteful habit and get closer to a more healthy life!

Thanks for reading :)

selftext: This is the first time I've posted here. I don't really know what to write as I've tried and failed over the last 3 years so many times. Where do I start???

Some background is that I quit smoking around 13 years ago for 10 YEARS. How did I start again? Well all it took was a week away on holiday, few few drinks to be social every night, then the odd cigarette just with a beer, turned into buying a pack to smoke the next day. I WAS HOOKED AGAIN.

I quickly switched to an E-cig, thinking I'll be able to get off these easily. But little did I know it has been far harder that coming off normal cigarettes. 

For the last 3 I've  been going between using patches and  E-cigs. I have had a month smoke free at best, but I always fail.

The trouble is that I can always just think it's just one wee E-cig to get my through that hour. I can smoke and my wife won't find out, I seek away too the shops and smoke and there is no smell. But I'm still totally hooked on nicotine and get the relief from a craving.

I seem to get so depressed after about 2 weeks and smoke again. It causes a lot a trouble with my wife as the see's that I'm never getting of the patches. I always causes arguments when she asks how it is going. 

I'm 4 days now smoke free. I'm finding this the hardest 4 days trying to quit. Maybe because I know this is my last chance to quit before I start a new job with lower wages, so I don't want to waste money on my nicotine addiction. 

Sorry for the long post

selftext: I stopped smoking cigarettes in January, and moved to vaping. It wasn't hard at all. I lost my vape stick a few days ago and managed to get through one whole day without nicotine \(my head was pulsing all day\), but I've since bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked 5 in the last 2 days.

I don't want to start smoking again, and I don't want to have a crutch anymore, but I have serious exams coming up in 2 weeks, and I'm afraid the side effects of quitting nicotine cold\-turkey will impact how I do.

I'm also afraid that I'm only telling myself that because I don't want to quit, and that if I do bad in exams and I did quit smoking at the same time, I'd just blame the poor results on quitting.

selftext: I was damn sure I'd never smoke again. I barely thought about cigarettes, barely had cravings and was disgusted by the smell. I got through two plus years smoke free...

Then I went on holiday 2 weeks ago and was in a country where I was surrounded by it 24/7, with cheap prices to boot. I caved whilst drinking then let myself smoke for the remainder of the trip. I smoked for about 10 days in total, some days 1 or 2, some days 10 depending if I was drinking. 

Anyway I'm back and I've completely stopped again, don't feel the desire for one at all. I'm adamant that I will not continue this at home. But this experience really broke me as person... If I could let this slip after 2 years when my guard was down for two seconds, what else could happen?

Does anyone also know if quitting this time will be less intense than two years ago when I was a full time pack a day smoker? I sure hope it is, especially since I already don't feel any cravings at all really, but I'm still scared somehow I'll let myself slip.

selftext: Hey Reddit. 

A bit of back story. I've smoked since I was 15. Over 20 years. Pack and a half a day. 
I was a couch potato for my twenties and started exercising in my 30s. I've tried to give up smoking on average once or twice a year for the last ten years. This time it's different. 

My dad got news about lung cancer last Christmas. He smoked a pipe all his life. I'm not going to describe what he is going through, what he looks like or the effect this is having on us all. Imagine it yourselves and now double it. 

I have not had a cigarette in two months. The want for one is nearly gone. My trigger was always alcohol. Always. My will power went out the window when I had pints. So anyway this is what helped me. 

•Stop drinking for at least a month

•Exercise - walk, run, anything at all

•Get outside and get some air into your new lungs

•Reward yourself after a set amount of time - buy yourself something 

•Change your eating habits, you will be hungry for a time - use this to eat healthy

•The first three days are the hardest with day two the worst for me

•The pain passes, It honestly does

•Drink plenty of water

•YOU CAN DO THIS

•When you finally go for a drink put yourself in a place you can leave if you want and preferably with non smokers

•The cravings go away in five minutes

•The craving strength lessens over time

•The number of cravings reduce to nearly nothing over time

•Distract yourself when you want one, take up a new hobby - paint, knit, sow, draw, run, swim, surf, climb, board games, make models, learn a new language, learn a new skill, take on a project. 

While two months is not that long a time I genuinely feel I have broken the back on this. I'm not allowing myself to say I'm a non smoker. I think I will be a smoker for the rest of my life but I will be one who doesn't smoke. I am not going to allow myself to become complacent - I have fallen into that trap before. 

So take my word for it. I see my dad now and no one wants that. Currently you are throwing money away in order to hurt yourself and feed a pointless need. 

If I told you to pay me to give you a pin so you could prick yourself you would call me mad. That's what you are doing for nicotine.. paying someone so you can hurt yourself. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Again I'm here with my dad with tubes in places (we made a joke of counting them earlier) that no one should. Don't be that and dont be someone who becomes that. Please, for you.

selftext: I am about 6 weeks into my quit. It has somehow been the easiest thing I've ever done. I've barely craved. I've had casual patio drinks and way too many campfire drinks and been clubbing and camping and hiking and to the beach. I've seen my non-smoking parents and chain-smoking friends and spent days without seeing anyone at all. I feel like I've hit every trigger possible at this point, but now, six weeks in, I've been getting the worst cravings of my entire quit.

I don't feel like my life has actually changed much since my quit, except that I'm maybe a little happier and a bit less smelly. I do have more free time, as I'm not wasting 5 min x 15 cigarettes a day (an hour and 15 minutes every day, over 55 HOURS in the last 6 weeks), but really that just gets folded into other tasks. I've spent my new found non-smoker wealth on upgrading my hiking gear. Life is, ostensibly, NORMAL. So WHY NOW?

What is it about NOW, after all of this, that is making me want to cave and buy a pack? I've been thinking about it non-stop for days. There are supposed to be no triggers left! Tell me I'm an idiot, please!

selftext: Hi there. 31/yo pack plus a few a day smoker for 10(ish) years. 

I'm going to have gastric bypass surgery and needed to quit smoking. I bought a vape and a bottle of 12mg nic. But that was too strong. So i bought a bottle of 3mg nic... and that wasnt enough. Ive been mixing. 

The plan is to ween off of nicotine for awhile... and then ween off the vape. 

I'm surprised at how well ive been doing. The vape has been a godsend. I work in a bar 6 nights a week... and cigarettes are EVERYWHERE. i haven't caved. And only had an emotional breakdown once. 

However... everyone keeps scaring me saying that vaping is way more dangerous than cigarettes. Popcorn lung... pneumonia... etc. Etc. Ive looked it up on the google machine... and i cant find sources to tell me if im worse off vaping than smoking. 

I see that many people in this sub use(d) vapes... did any of you get horrible lung issues? Or pneumonia? 

Glad i found this sub! Thanks in advance!

selftext: So, I've been down to a single cigarette per day for a long time now.  It's always a struggle to keep it to that one, but I generally manage unless there is alcohol involved.  I just don't know how to get rid of that last cigarette!

Sometimes I can even go a week without a cigarette, but eventually the cravings catch up with me and I wind up buying a pack.

Sometimes I feel like I'm going to constantly be fighting with this.  Will there always be cravings?  I don't even think it's just nicotine.  I actually enjoy the act of smoking.

Honestly, I'm posting because I'm not sure what to do at this point and am very frustrated.

selftext: I quit for a full year in 2014, but with an e-cig. 

In 2016 I quit for a solid 6 months, cold turkey. It was great. How did I start up again? Gradually, bumming off coworkers, then bumming so much I graduated to buying them packs....then that spilled into buying packs again. Within a week I am back to a pack a day. 

Have a great Christmas this year and started 2018 with no cigs. Lasted a month, and within 2 days of smoking again, I am back at a pack a day. 

Now my intake has increased even more, I'm smoking more than ever, I can feel it destroying my lungs. I want to quit so bad yet, at the same time, feel I have the lowest motivation to quit. I don't want to go through it again. I know all about it, after about the 10th day of cold turkey things really start improving. But then at some point I inevitably fall back into it. It seems hopeless and worthless. I am disgusted by them and love them at the same time. I want to quit and be done with them forever yet still want to be a smoker. 

I am stuck. 

Edit: started at 18, it has been 8 years of smoking. I can't believe I have been a smoker my entire adult life. I don't want to wake up at 30 and still be smoking. Hell I don't want to hit the 10 year mark. Sometimes I feel the damage has already been done so why quit anyway.

selftext: I'm on day five of quitting, and still going strong. My doctor originally prescribed me some nicotine patches to help me with cravings. Since I had been smoking about 2 packs or more a day he put me on the highest dosage of 21  mgs. First day was fine, but then I noticed the past several days my heart beat would be racing a million beats every night and I always felt winded. Then I started getting these really awful pains that would come in spasms starting in the left side of my back, to the frnt of the left chest. Sometime feeling like they were just within my chest, rather than front or back. They were very similar to the cardiovascular related pains I've felt with other drugs. I'm hoping at least it is that, and not lung cancer developing right when I am ready to kick the habit. Though it would be darkly humorous. 

Has anyone experienced these symptoms with patches? Should I try cutting them in half and only wearing a smaller strip of them? Or even 1/4th of one? 

I'm actually typing this now to fight a craving, but it's passed now so I'm good. But I'm just hoping I don't have cancer or something.

selftext: Friday, May 11, 2018, will be my 14th smokefree birthday.   

Not a single bit of nicotine in 14 years. 

If I can do this, you can too. 

I was utterly hopeless.  I was to the point where I hated smoking.  Hated hated hated it.  Hated myself for doing it.   But smoking, and hating it, and hating myself, was "easier" and "less painful" than a few days of discomfort and some understanding how your body's addiction worked, and how it can be broken.  

Until that one day.  May 11, 2004.   Three months shy of 36 years old.    In my car.  Smoking a last cigarette, from a pack I'd just bought.  I just *had* to go out and get a pack.  I *need* that pack.  *Need* it.  

Driving back home and polluting my lungs, I finally thought it. 

"I'm sick of this shit."

I'm sick of my addiction controlling me.  I'm sick of having to smoke. I'm sick of needing this.  I'm sick of the lost money. I'm sick of my wife, my friends and my kid frowning at me because I smell so bad.  I'm sick of hiding this from people.  I'm sick of going to such lengths to smoke and then hide it.  I'm sick of hacking up my lungs in the morning.  I'm sick of getting winded walking up half a flight of stairs.  I'm sick of getting bronchitis every year for 15 years now.   

I'm' sick of quitting and starting, quitting and starting, quitting and failing. I'm sick of getting 3 or 4 days under my belt and then giving in and smoking.  I'm sick of getting juuuust over that hump and then going back.   This is crazy.

I'm sick of this shit.   

I tossed the pack away.  I went home.  I went to bed.  

The next day I shoved nicotine gum in my mouth and suffered through 2 days of intense physical withdrawal with the gum just taking the edge off. 

Day 3 was better.  Day 4 was even better.   Day 5 was OK. 

I got rid of the gum on day 10.  

Day 11 was tough.

Day 12 was OK. 

Day 13 was GREAT.   

Not a cigarette since then.  

You can do this.  YOU CAN DO THIS.

selftext: After many previous quit attempts that lasted from weeks to months, but always resulted in a return to the ole ciggies, I've switched to vaping. I had been smoking a pack a day (for 23 years or so), so started on 18mg nicotine. Am down to 12mg after just 2-3 weeks, and finding it fine. Liking the taste of vaping much more than cigarettes, and although it most likely isn't *harmless*, it's definitely a *better* option than what I was doing. 

I plan to slowly move down to 0 nicotine and eventually off it altogether. Keen to hear others' experiences with this.

I know not everyone in this sub thinks this is a "valid" way to quit smoking, but please keep the comments helpful. Whatever works for you, I say. Thanks.

It's been happening more and more often, and it's only making life worse.  Now, I get anxious unless I have a steady supply of nicotine, all day.  I'm just on the edge of being a chain-smoker on the weekends.  I've kinda dug myself deeper into the nicotine-addiction hole while trying to claw out of it.  So..  I'm done.

I have a stack of Allen Carr books.  I've read them.  I'm on EasyWay ths morning.  You can't get off heroin by shooting more heroin.  Nicotine?  It's been real.  Alcohol?  Ciao.  I'm done, today.

selftext: 32 days quit- cold turkey, no NRT.  Smoked a pack a day for almost 15 years and never tried to stop. Told myself that I had to give quitting a real effort- if I failed, I could at least say I tried when nagged about my habit. I expected to fail. 
32 days later and for the first time I woke up and smoking wasn’t the first thing on my mind. 

Things that helped- 

1.. healthy Competition and social support. Husband quit at the same time. told him I couldn’t quit unless he didn’t smoke around me, and he opted to quit too. I am so grateful, and if he wanted to start again I think I’m strong enough to maintain my quit anyway, but I think he is happy to have quit and hopefully stays quit for himself. Good friend also quit around the same time and it was nice to have people around who understood what I was going through. 
2. Promised myself I would complete the following list in order before giving into a craving:
        Drink a glass of water
        1 lap around the block 
        Take a shower 
        Chew a piece of nicotine gum 
        Buy and use an e-cig
I never made it past walk around the block- by the time I was done with that the craving had passed. 
3. Ate a lot. Ive gained 6 lbs, but I joined Weight Watchers today and am hopeful I can at least stop gaining. A few extra pounds was worth it and snacks definitely helped me fight cravings 
4. Avoided things that would trigger me like drinking until I felt more confident. I was already so uncomfortable those first couple of weeks- why make it worse? 
5. Reminding myself that resisting cravings makes me stronger, and the only thing another cig will do for me is make me want another cig. 
6. Made a list of all the good things I had to gain from quitting and referred to it often.
7. Went easy on myself. During this process I’ve snapped at my husband unnecessarily several times, eaten too much unhealthy food, and abandoned chores for several days. But I quit, and that’s awesome. It’s okay to not be perfect while you quit, just don’t smoke. 
8. I tried to acknowledge but then purposefully ignore the ridiculous things my addict brain came up with- like “I’m going smoke anyway, might as well be now” or “if I’m going to feel miserable, what’s the point?” I was truly my own worst enemy. I don’t view cigarettes as evil- but that addicted part of me that tried to sabotage myself? Yeah- she’s the worst. 


I am so happy to say “I don’t smoke.” I never want to feel the extreme discomfort of needing a cigarette again. The first day without cigarettes I cried, and I continued to grieve for quite awhile. But I stuck it out and am really proud of myself. You deserve this feeling too. Good luck to all.

selftext: I’ve been on nicotine patches for 45 days and scaled down the dosage as instructed.  Yesterday I went patch free and the cravings are a bit stronger now.  Had a dream last night about smoking and woke up thinking for a second that I would go outside and have a wake up smoke.  It was only a second before I remembered I’m a nonsmoker.   The fact that my subconscious forgot that fact concerned me.  There’s been a few moments where I feel a bit panic stricken.  I do feel that my practice in overcoming the psychological cravings first while using the patch is helping me go through now final physical withdrawals and remain strong.  The cravings so far are a bit stronger than anticipated and this last day has been harder than I thought .  Oh well 2 days to go before the nicotine is completely expelled from my body.  Wish me luck!  I’m sticking to my quit.

selftext: TLDR at bottom 

Yeah, my body is addicted to nicotine. I stopped smoking about 6 months ago, and took up vaping instead. The plan was to keep reducing the nicotine until it was at 0, then stop altogether. 

I've almost reduced the nic to 0, im at 2 right now. It doesn't even feel like I'm craving the nicotine. There will be times when I'm stressed and I sit there and vape and vape and vape until I'm sick from nicotine. Even after I'm nic-sick, I have the urge to keep vaping. I don't want nicotine and the thought of it makes me sick in these times, yet I still have a horrible urge to vape or smoke. 


Does anyone else relate? I feel like that's the only thing holding me back from quitting vaping. 

TLDR: even when I'm sick from nicotine I still feel the need to vape , even when the thought of nic makes me sick. Anyone else relate? It's the only thing holding me back.

selftext: I realized some time not that long ago that I've been a smoker for half of my life, I started when I was 17 and now I'm 34.  Every time I light I cigarette, I feel miserable about it and pretty much just hate myself.  I bought a vape last year to try and make the switch to something "healthier" but I ended up just using that on top of smoking.  I'd go a few days with no cigarettes and feel really great about it, and then I would find something to stress about and go out and buy a pack.  

I've spent so much time in smoking rooms in international airports, covered in the stink of twenty different kinds of smokes, huddled outside in the cold after a nice dinner, rushing away from the table to get a cig after drinks, and pretending that smoking was an enjoyable part of my morning coffee/contemplation ritual.  

I've had a lot of false starts over the years, I've gone two weeks, I've gone a month at my longest, but I always come back to it.  

Tomorrow will be my first day as a non\-smoker/non\-nicotine user.  Today, I feel like I'm finally ready to wrestle control from this disgusting habit and take my lungs back.  I keep telling myself that it's not about what I'll be giving up, but about what I'll get from doing this.  I don't want lung cancer, I don't want to develop some sort of heart disease, I don't want to reek of of smoke, or stand in smoke filled glass cages desperately sucking on the end of a cigarette because I can't handle a nine hour plane ride and a layover. I don want to keep telling my  six year old nephew that someday I'll quit when he asks me why I do something that's so unhealthy. 

I'm feeling determined.

Here's hoping I can see this through.

selftext: Just as the title says, I only really crave cigarettes when I drink alcohol. Lowered inhibitions cause me to buy a pack, and then I just smoke them throughout the week. By the time the next weekend rolls around, I'm out of cigarettes again, and I inevitably buy another pack. Also somewhat hurts that a lot of my friends smoke, so there's always cigarettes around.

Anyone have any experience with this sort of cycle? I'm really ready to quit, I just need strategies to combat cravings when I drink.

selftext: TL;DR: So far so good, noticing a range of effects. 

I would like to document my progress with Chantix and share it. If you guys are interested I'll answer questions and post updates. This is kind of long. Mostly about the drug, relevant background info about me is at the end. 

I'm currently starting my second week. This is day 1 of full dose and no cigarettes. 

Week 1 was mostly uneventful. During Week 1 I was allowed to smoke, and the dosage gradually increased.

First I'll go over the side effects. I had some oddly vivid dreams on Day 6. Slightly more vivid and memorable than usual. The kind that you still remember a few days later. Nothing major, first one was kinda sexual, second one was kinda violent. I was an observer, not a participant. I remembered more detail than usual and the content was interesting and a little disturbing, but these definitely were not nightmares. 

As for the desired effect, it's working very well. After a few days I started to lose interest in cigarrettes. On Day 4 I stayed up late drinking and smoked a pack (probably close to 2 total that day, plus vaping). The next day I only had 3 cigarettes. I smoked no more than 5 a day on the remaining two days. Today I've had zero, with one very minimal urge during lunch. Every time I smoked after day 4 it tasted bad, felt toxic and harmful, and had no reward to mask what the cigarettes were really doing to my body. 

There are also unexpected but desirable effects. It seems like Chantix has curbed my addictive personality entirely. I have a broad range of unhealthy habits that I've been wrestling with for years. I've found that every urge is weaker, and in most cases there is significantly less payoff when I act on them. I feel like I can finally exert control over several areas of my life without draining my willpower. I'm not any more motivated than I already was, I'm simply less drained from fighting with myself all the time. However, this can be a bad thing because I suspect Chantix indiscriminately interferes with established reward circuits. If I had a ton if good habits, or habits I didn't want to break, I'd be calling this anhedonia, which I believe is a commonly reported side effect. 

I researched the side effects and I'm reasonably concerned about them. I have a history of depression and I drink. I've had other mental health issues in the past where I mildly hallucinated and experienced intense paranoia and panic attacks coupled with manic episodes. It was a bad reaction to medication. If this works for me hopefully this will become a good account of the effects of this drug for people that may benefit from it. If not this will become yet another cautionary tale about the dangers of taking Chantix.

My impression at this point is the nicotine withdrawal will trigger the intense dreams, because the first oddly vivid ones happened on Day 6, after my nicotine intake had dropped significantly. I've read accounts where the dreams started several weeks in, and others where bad side effects started almost right away and they had to quit after a few days of taking the full dose.

I'm expecting the side effects I've been warned about to manifest at some point, but I've mostly kept it together through some pretty intense episodes in the past so it will take a lot to make me stop.

Background: 

Been smoking for 6-7 years, gradually smoking more and more. Started passing the pack a day mark recently. I'll go through a pack in a few hours on weekends when I'm drinking. Basically chain smoking whenever I have time, and often when I don't have time. I also vape while indoors.

I'm a big guy, athletic and muscular build with a little extra fluff. 6'3", 255 lbs, late 20's. The dose appears to be the same for everyone, so I wonder if my extremely mild side effects are related to my size and age.

selftext: I am 24 years old and have been a smoker for 4 years... 3/4 pack a day. I decided that I need to quit for a plethora of reasons (Why shouldn't one quit). Anyway, I quit on Saturday so I had been sober from cigarettes for 4 full days. Last night, I was in a really frustrating spot with my ex boyfriend and feeling really stressed and I caved an bought a pack. I have since then smoked 2 cigarettes - which I will say were both completely disgusting. Tasted gross, made me wonder what I am doing. I had a headache after both cigarettes. 

I am just wondering if anybody has any advice about how to move forward. I can accept that I have caved and smoked 2 cigs, that it's not the end of the world. But I would really like to prevent myself from sliding backwards and becoming a regular smoker again.

selftext: I quit cold turkey about 11 days ago, I still have my last half a pack of cigarettes I bought just sitting there on my dresser so I can tell myself I'm quitting because I want to. They don't have any affect on me so I keep them there, it's kind of a mental thing.

My way of quitting was a little different than most, not only did I quit smoking but I quit everything that triggered it as a habit, I limited my driving, coffee, even eating. It may sound extreme but it definitely helped and it drastically lessened the frequency of cravings for me. For the times that I did eat, I immediately replaced the after smoking ritual with just eating cinammon fireballs or gum.

The driving and eating triggers were taken care of so I figured I'd have my first cup of decaf coffee in 11 days today, and boy was that a bad idea. I got so flustered and couldn't stop pacing from room to room until I finally caved in and took one out of that pack. The good part though was that I couldn't even finish a quarter of the cigarette before I started getting dizzy and nauseous. It's been almost 16 years since my first cigarette, but smoking this one was exactly how that first one taste. This time though, instead of pushing myself through the disgusting taste and dizzying headache to finish it for the sake of my reputation among my teenage peers, I quickly put it out and threw it away. Part of me feels ashamed that I gave in, but another part of me feels OK that It showed me the true repulsive taste I have been masking by habit all these years.

I was never a morning person, or so I thought. The biggest pro of quitting has been waking up in the morning so easily it amazes me. Now instead of waking up to a big headache and heading outside to smoke the first cigarette of the day, I wake up and go have breakfast with my kids, instead of feeling ashamed to be around them wondering how bad I smell like tobacco to them. Even if I get a less than ideal amount of hours of sleep I still wake up 100x better than if I would've if I would've gotten a full nights rest as a a smoker. Stay strong... Those first 3-4 days are the only days you'll feel it, and even then don't worry about tomorrow, just worry about getting passed the next 15 minutes when you're having a craving.. I've been smoking so long everyone I know doubted I could quit, so If I could do it you definitely can.

On day three I still had cravings, but they were more like an annoying mosquito bite to be ignored. 

I've been smoking for 12 years. I have seriously quit somewhere between 10-20 times. The longest I have refrained from tobacco is 3 months.

Eventually, I started to crave them and crave them. I realized that both as a future doctor as well as a person, I couldn't continue this. I decided to make a change. I threw out all of the tobacco in my house and purchased the patch to control cravings. Today as of now I'm 36 hrs without a cigarette. I got the patch (level 2) and it's amazing how much it kills cravings. Yes it has nicotine, but the goal is to titrate down to level 3 and then eventually quit completely. 

I'm excited to see how this progresses.

selftext: About a year and a half ago I made my first real attempt at quitting. My habit wasn’t terrible, but it was there. I was 31 at the time. Had been smoking regularly since 15.  At worst my habit was 3-4 packs per week.  But I usually settled in the 2-3 range.  Anyway my physician just said try. So I did. I went with Wellbutrin. It worked for me. I stopped smoking for the better part of 4 months.  I was also sober at this time.  Then I started drinking again, then the Wellbutrin alcohol combo made me feel terrible so I stopped taking the pills, then I started smoking again.  Anyway a couple months of cigs. Then I put them down and went to a vape. No smoking cigs, just vape for probably the last year. Well long story short I went on a party trip last weekend and I thought I deserved to smoke real cigs. Hell. It was vacation. Drank myself into oblivion each day/night and smoked 4 packs in 3 days. After that trip I was so hungover and sick I decided I never wanted to do that shit again. 

I’m on day 6, no nicotine of any kind.  Been a rough go. Short fuse, very irritable but I know it will pass.  It will be worth it to finally, finally be nicotine free and not having to use a prescription.  I won’t smoke today.

selftext: Im 1.5 years into quitting (smoked 25 years) and not once have I regretted quitting. However, each cigarette you smoke will be regretted. 
I can honestly say that quitting has relieved me of so much burden: how i feel about myself, not worrying about how i smell, not timing activities so ill have a smoke break, not having to ask whoever im in a car with to make a pitstop for cigs, not having to hide from family and friends who will be judgey, not alternating from feining to feeling nautious, not having to get out of bed in the middle of the night to smoke...
What made me quit was suddenly no matter how much i smoked i still craved a cigarette. Sort of like my body was asking for the nicotine but couldnt absorb it. Because of that i figured i might as well quit if i wasnt getting relief from smoking anymore.

selftext: Hey All,


Longtime lurker, first time poster. I want to start by saying that the comments in this community have been helpful to me in the past. Thank you for that. 


So I've been a pack-a-day smoker for ten years. Over the past year, I've tried to quit and failed I don't know how many times. Vaping seems to work for me. I can get to the month point using 3mg nicotine cartridges. For whatever reason, though, my mindset just totally goes to shit once I get there. I've had anxiety and depression all my life, and I know that cigarettes make that worse, but after a month smoke free, I turn into a totally different person.


It stops being, "you're going to die and you're a terrible person" and it starts being, "everyone and everything else is the reason that you are so miserable." I turn into a huge fucking prick, basically, and the negativity just becomes all consuming. So I broke after three weeks this time; I started smoking again four days ago just to see if that's what it was and I'm finally feeling somewhat normal.


I desperately want to quit and be a healthy, happy person, but if it means I'm going to fuck my life up in other ways, I'm not sure that it's worth it. I don't want to lose my fiance, for example, because I've convinced myself (erroneously) that she's the cause of all my problems. 


Does anyone here have experience dealing with this kind of thing?

Thanks in advance for your replies.

selftext: I will start by saying I'm not a smoker and never have been. I've lurked your subreddit for a bit and it's given me a much better understanding and appreciation of what a challenge quitting smoking is. 

I have never been able to stand smoking - the smell, the teeth, the waste of money, the breath. My boyfriend only smokes when he drinks (maybe half pack in a 4-5 hour period of drinking) and he's wanting to quit because he wants to, but also because he knows how much I hate it. He's spoken to his doctor and there is a trial program he's participating in to help him with the process. 

Here is what I've picked up from searching on here, please let me know if there is anything else that someone you love has done that helped you, or if there are any other do's (just as important, don't) that I should be aware of.

* Buy a fidget spinner or something for him to do with his hands
* Buy some dum dum suckers and gum
* Don't get upset if he gives into his cravings once or twice throughout the process
* Frequently compliment him on not smelling, or noticing that he's doing well
* Hold off on going out for a bit (I've already suggested we don't go to bars for a few weeks)
* Ask him each night how he did that day
* If he starts getting a craving, try to distract him or leave the area
* Acknowledge he'll be grumpy for the first few weeks
* Ensure that he's wanting to quit because he wants to, and not just to make me happy

He has two bars he frequents a lot and all his friends hang out at. He also works at one of them - so it's difficult for me to completely remove him from the situation. I don't want to keep him from his friends, so it may be an obstacle we need to work around. Suggestions around approaching that conversation would also be appreciated!

Thanks!!

selftext: So I gave my cigarettes to my spouse. The last few quit attempts, I destroyed the pack but he \(non\-smoker\) got pissy with me because they could be given to homeless people. Please don't lecture me; I think that if you're dealing with that much stress, you are allowed some nicotine vices. 

Regardless, those cigarettes were NOT given to anyone. I found them. Is it unreasonable to ask the he dispose of them? Or at least give them away? I'm going crazy knowing where they are. If I end up going through his bag to get them I am going to feel like a crazy person and I'm worried the temptation is too great.

With tons of research, I'm drinking a ton of water, juicing, healthy crap, vitamin c, Apple cider vinegar....just your general detox that I'll probably also use when I quit kratom. 

It's a $20/hr part time job with benefits so I can still do graveyard CNA shifts to get my experience up. My ultimate goal is BSN. But clearly, I gotta get my shit together first. Wish me luck. And luck to all of you as well!

I had about a pack a day habit, and I have called it quits 3 days ago. I feel in pain, I have been getting  angry at my mom for no reason and I get agitated easily. I feel as though I'm going about this alone and it is making it so hard for me. Nobody understands that I am having trouble sleeping, have a weird feeling in my head, and crave nicotine soooo much.

selftext: Hi all,
I’ve never posted before, so please forgive if this is awkwardly written.

I had quit smoking for a month and a half, then had a weak moment after a few beers and caved. That was a few weeks back, and I’ve been bumming smokes off my fiancé everyday since then (I bought two packs myself, but mostly just taking his). 
He has talked about quitting, but never acted on it. We live together, and he usually leaves the cigarettes on the porch when he’s home, so it’s not like I have to ask to have one. I think he secretly is ok with me smoking, because it takes the pressure off him to quit. He is a pretty heavy smoker, almost a pack a day, sometimes more. 

I know I can’t change his habit, only my own..but does anyone have advice for dealing with a partner who still smokes?

I’ve decided that today I will try again to quit, and do my best to stick with it, cigarettes nearby be damned!

selftext: Hey everyone, first time posting here. I've been a smoker for 4 years, cycling between a pack a day, to vaping 24/7, to nicotine gum, to nicotine inhalers, and to patches. I've also tried a variety of supplement combos. I've always tried to go at it alone, with no support. I'm 21 and living at home as a full time student. Both my mom and brother are heavy smokers, so I cannot ask for support from them. None of my friends are addicted (social smokers).

 I don't know where to go. If you guys can share with me what has worked for you, I'd really appreciate it. My mind is playing tricks on me and I need to know that I'm not alone...

selftext: Hello fellow stoppers, I have a question that you guys might be able to answer. I recently stopped smoking, went from smoking around 15 RYO per day to none, and I’m on my fifth day. Yesterday night I went partying with friends, they smoked, I resisted the occasional urges without any problems, so all is good. Shows that you can party hard even if you quit. But today after waking up and going about my day my lungs feel as if I’ve smoked a whole pack yesterday. Might be the hangover, I dunno. Might be the fact that we were in a room where people could smoke (so second-hand), might be the analgesic effect of nicotine wearing off and making me feel the years of bullshit accumulated in my lungs, I really don’t know. Have you guys experienced something like this after quitting?

selftext: Week one sucked.... but since day 10, I've had only the odd crave.... and they were entirely manageable. It totally has not been as dramatic, or as difficult as I feared. So why have I failed so often before? And why is THIS quit kicking nicotine's ass so easily? I'm genuinely confused. I suspect Allen Carr had a lot to do with it. 

Because I thought it would be so hard, I stalled. I thought
* No way. I can't do this
* I will be missing something
* I will eventually fail

Let me be clear. *I was 100% sure I would fail*! But it turns out I was wrong. The nicotine monster is like Freddy Kruger..... fear and nicotine make him stronger. You don't think about him, he goes away. You don't feed him, he dies. He can't fight you AT ALL if you don't smoke. It's an incredible weakness he has.... so you can kill him.

Am on my third attempt to quit in last 3 months. Maximum I went was 14 days smoke free and all of a sudden am back smoking. 

Have been a smoker for around 12 years with Average 10 ciggrates a day. So my questions are :

1- How soon should I expect to get better in terms of health stamina lungs etc etc. Am gyming for last 1.5 years. Cardio and all. And been a athlete for almost all my life. 

2- am using nicotine patches this time. Stage 2 ones. Is it fine using them. I am using them because I don't wanna go back smoking again and will do anything for it. 

My goal is simple. To build muscles and be a dad soon :)  and if I remain a smoker I won't get the desired results. 

Suggestions?? 

Thanks for reading.

selftext: Week 1 \- 2: I battled the physical addiction, had smoker's flu, was coughing like mad.

Week 3 \- 4: I battled the emotional addiction.

Week 5 \- 6: The craving subsided, it was much easier to manage triggers. My body felt much better.

Week 7 \- 9 \(now\): I've been having difficult time sleeping, constantly feel the urge to belch/burp. Never had \(or aware\) acid reflux in my life, but now I have it, chest feel like burning, there is this feeling of something stuck in my throat. Life's been pretty hectic, the most stressful period in this year.

Smoked for 6 months, smoked pretty casually for the first 3 months \(1 pack a month\), then the last 3 months I went full on addicted \(half a pack a day\), until I finally decided to quit.

Have anyone had this issue before? This is getting really annoying. I have multiple deadline in a few weeks time, and I need to be in shape to finish them. At this point, after what I've been through, I'm definitely positive that I won't have another drag anymore.

I really, really need to keep my morning black coffee. I used to have my coffee and cigs every morning, I still keep that habit sans the cigs. I usually skip breakfast and will have late lunch around 2\-3pm? I've been gouging aluminum antacid in the past 3 weeks, it doesn't seem to help much. Anything I can do to make this go away, except, please, if i can keep my morning coffee.

selftext: Hey Reddit. Any advice?

I have been smoking cigarettes for 10 years now, mostly a pack a day. It has always been my crutch and companion. Have been doing quit attempts every year. Nothing really seems to work. I'm starting to feel hopeless about quitting.. Somehow, in the back of my mind though I have a feeling I will succeed someday. Just need to find a way..

----- Have read Allen Carr's book 3 times, always get great motivation to quit but cave in after 1-7 days ----- Have switched to swedish snus. It's easy to do and the lungs start healing. But the constant supply of nicotine is so much I find myself being a bit "off" and exhausted all day ----- Cold turkey 3-4 times, lasting for a week ----- Nicotine gum ----- Vaping. It led me to chaining all day, especially with low-nic. 0-nic felt "pointless" to smoke.. ----- Weed, it's okay but can't just smoke all day ----- Practice yoga 3-5 times a week, eat mostly healthy -----

When I don't have a cigarette for a few days I get into this dream-like state where things are surreal. A portion of my day goes to thinking about smoking versus not. In this state I feel like I'm living for nothing, like my days are spent just waiting for them to end. Senses and clarity are heightened though. It's amazing but at the same time exhausting. Need to get out of it....just for a moment.

After some time I cave in. The first hit of nicotine makes me relaxed, content with the whole world. 
It feels like I have been wearing a 40-pound armor for a few days straight, and then get to get it off. Feels like a feather again! I can fly through a day and be friendly to people.
Then after a day or two, smoking a few cigarettes, I get numb again. Just smoking cigarettes to get through the day, no big feelings. Clarity has gone, I want to quit again. 

What could the lesson in this be? Thank you for listening /stopsmoking

selftext: After numerous attemps to stop smoking I haven't lasted more than 3 days without smoking, been smoking for 4 years a pack a day of Marlboro reds, getting close to 2 packs in the weekends \(blame the alcohol\). It's 05:12AM at the moment and I have 3 cigarettes left, I'll smoke the last 3 ones and hope to never smoke again. I have some worries though, but doesn't everyone? My main worries are:

\- I'm single now, but I'm worried about what happens if I start dating a girl who happens to smoke, since I smoked throughout all of my relationships and all of my exes were smokers.

\- Worried that I'll relapse while drinking alcohol

\- The possible gain in weight

Goodluck to everyone who's in the same situation, the thought of quitting for real this time is both a relief and a huge challenge.

selftext: Today marks my 3rd week smoke and nicotine free! Yayy

But my cravings throughout last week were stronger than the previous two combined! It’s as though my brain is starting to realize I’m serious about this quit. I never did a ceremonial last cigarette or anything.. I just was hungover one day and didn’t want any. When I had made it 3 days or so I just decided fuck it, I’ll stick with it.

But this last week was brutal. And I think it’s because I introduced having a couple alcoholic drinks into my social life again. Nothing crazy, just some wine one day and mimosas another.

But seriously, for over an hour or more, all I did was think about going home and smoking a cigarette. I was cuddling with my girlfriends and you’d think that would keep those thoughts away.. but no. All I could think about was smoking, it invaded my thoughts entirely.

I’ve skipped going out a couple of these nights because just as soon as I decided I wanted to hit the clubs, all I could think was how it was okay to have a couple cigarettes. You know, my brain was rationalizing everything away.

“Oh, you can just be the girl that has a cigarette or two or three while she drinks. It isn’t a big deal, and is totallly sustainable.” 

Like, NO brain! Please! 

When do these thoughts go away? Do they ever? 

Or do you just sorta become the smoker that fights herself every night to not smoke. Because it’s hard to enjoy things when all I’m doing is fantasizing about sparking up. Ughhh

At least we made it to 3 weeks y’all! ✨💖

selftext: What helped me is repeating the phrase “this craving will pass whether you smoke or not”. Also SUNFLOWER SEEDS. Don’t stop eating them. I quit last April and smoked for 15 years. You can do it. Be kind to yourself. I know you can do it!

I moved into my old place last year with 2 Doctors who were non-smokers and in order to live there I couldn’t smoke either. Also, this will probably be the most difficult for some people, but you gotta stay away from friends that smoke for a few months. Or jobs like in the restaurant industry where breaks are smoke filled.

All of this came together for me to quit today I realized it’s been (over) a whole year. I promise the cravings will stop or at least be increasingly infrequent. Make sure you have back up bags of sunflower seeds at your house.

I realize that depression is part of quitting smoking but it seemed like it got pretty bad. Is it normal for it to get this bad?

I wasn't suicidal but wasn't happy about being alive. I do suffer from clinical depression but my meds keep it under control pretty well. At this point I don't know if the nicotine and MAOIs (in cigarettes) were helping to keep my depression under control or if it's purely depression from the withdrawal.

Or perhaps the lack of nicotine and or other chemicals means I would need a dose adjustment for my meds.

Today is my one week mark and I’m feeling pretty good. I felt it would be beneficial to document it here amongst all you supportive people. 
I started smoking when I was 16 which was 7 years ago and I was instantly hooked. I very quickly (within my first few weeks of smoking) became a pack a day smoker. 
Now I’m 23 and I became so tired of the chore of smoking and last week at 2 packs a day I said fuck it, bought a NRT device and threw away a pack and a half of smokes. 
I’ve been so happy this past week with my decision and the way my lifestyle is changing and that feeling is overwhelming any possibility of regret for not smoking anymore or any want to go back to it.
I appreciate anyone for reading this and wish you all good luck on your quitting journeys as well.

selftext: Hello, 
I don't know what to do, so I'm asking for your help.

My mother is about to quit smoking.
She is 57 years old and she smokes since she was like 12.

It is the first time ever that she will give it a try. (she don't have any choices left, since her doctor wont removes the things she has in the throat if she don't quit smooking)
We know that it will be rough, especially because she literally stop travelling when they forbid cigarettes on airplanes, because she wasnt able to pass through a full 5 hours without smoking... Before that, she was going to one destination per year.

So the anxiety level she is experiencing without nicotine must be sky high for her... 

She'll have patches and a spray to provide her some nicotine during the process. But she did use the spray thing to survive her last flight on a plane, and it was a total nightmare. So I really don't know if theses things will be helpful to keep her anxiety at bay at all...

My question is, what can we do as an external person to help her to pass through this withdrawal anxiety issue?
If anyones have tricks or idea to make this whole process easier for her... I'm not sure what I can do, but I would like to help her as much as possible.

Thank you :)

TL;DR: My mother is going to try to quit smoking, I would like to be as helpful as possible to her in that process but don't know exactly how. 

EDIT: 3 weeks today that she hasnt touch a cigaret! Thanks for your advices :) 
I don't know if this info could help others but since she was missing the habit to hold something between her fingers and that she used to carry her little pack of cigaret everywhere, I gave her a little pack with fake cigarets that I made out of paper straw filled with paper. She said it helped her a lot. Every time I go at her home she has one in her hand.

selftext: I've been noticing something recently and I'd be really interested to hear if other people have had similar experiences. 

I've been a non smoker for 59 days now and it's honestly been great. Haven't been close to a relapse so far, just been fighting back those addictive thoughts with increasing ease as they get weaker and weaker. I call my internal voice of addiction 'Gollum', because it keeps trying to tell me how 'awesome/relaxing/not that big of a deal' smoking is even though it's obviously trying to kill me (my favourite bit of Gollum logic is 'Hey, since it's been pretty easy to quit smoking, you might as well just light a cigarette if you feel like it! You can *really* quit any time you like! You are a unicorn who is immune to nicotine addiction!').

Anyway, Gollum has been getting weaker and less present pretty steadily over the past few weeks, to a point where he's almost non-existent, and when he does pop up I can just shut him down with a firm 'shut the fuck up you fucking dickhead' (internally, of course, otherwise people in the frozen food aisle would start looking at me funny).

However, in the past few days, the addictive thoughts have been returning a little bit, I think? I've had some stressfull days at work and working on my thesis. I'm noticing cravings more frequently, not necessarily stronger ones, just more of them. It's not unbearable, it's just... annoying. I don't think I'll fall for them any time soon as I'm still enjoying being a non-smoker far too much, but I'm hoping there will come a time where I won't have to deal with them anymore. I'm already stressed out, and now I have to waste all this mental energy debating my own stupid personification of my addiction. It just sucks. 

Sort of a **TL;DR**: Do you still get those weird intrusive thoughts trying to convice you to smoke again? Has there been a period in your quit where they got worse again, after the initial withdrawals? I'm really interested in hearing your stories.


P.S. By the way, thank you for all the amazing advice and support you've been posting here - I haven't posted much myself, but just reading other people's questions and advice has been so helpful. I'm really loving being smoke free, it's honestly been such an enjoyable life change and a large part of that is because of this subreddit :)

P.P.S. Sorry this is so long and self-indulgent, I guess I also just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me :)

selftext: First of all, let me say that I am really proud of how far I've come (149 days!) and I know that all of my reasons for quitting are valid and far outweigh any "pros" I may delude myself into considering. 

That being said, man I just hate the feeling that I'm not having as much fun when I'm not smoking. For the past 14 years I've been a "drinking smoker", and predominately only when I was around other smokers. If I was sober, or if I was alone, the chances were very slim that I'd smoke. I feel grateful that my only triggers revolve around drinking. That being said, I am around those triggers quite a bit (especially because my husband still smokes). I can go weeks without craving a cigarette, but the second I am drinking around other smokers I feel like I'm missing out. I know it's all psychological, but I'd love to hear from some more long-term quitters about whether this feeling goes away.

selftext: Four years ago I decided I was done smoking for good, done with the shame, done with the paranoia over my health, especially after watching my parents suffer through smoking related diseases - my mother passed two years later from lung cancer. After nine years and three attempts, the longest of which was 5 months, I woke up on May 8th, 2014 and decided I was a non smoker. 

I won't tell you it was easy in the beginning. I had to learn how to be idle without smoking, go through breakups and deaths, get drunk, be angry. Smoking carves a niche into every facet on your life but I guarantee you that are stronger than it. 

The first couple weeks were difficult and I remember day 9 being the worst day where I contemplated suicide. I knew if I smoked the feelings would go away but it would be fleeting and I'd be back at square one all over again. I knew if I just took a breath and let the moment pass, the pride I would feel in kicking this addiction would be beyond any feeling nicotine could manufacture. By the end of the first year my family would tell me they didn't even remember me smoking and couldn't picture it. Being a non-smoker became such a natural thing to me. I still check in here sometimes to remind myself to never take another puff, though cravings are very rare. 

If you're in the early days please don't give up. Make the choice not to smoke every day and before you know it you'll be celebrating years of being smoke-free too!

The first month was by far the hardest.
It gradually got better, still had many urges tho until month 9/10.

Since then i didn't have a single urge.
I totally have the power over those cancer sticks.
I can hold a cigarette for a friend, turn it in my hands, watch it burn, smell it, being around alot of smokers, having conversations with random people in university, going out and being drunk, **without even thinking about taking a single puff** . It's like i've been thrown back before the time i used to smoke, where cigarettes were kinda mysterious for me and i didn't get why people even smoke.

Smoking doesn't make sense to me anymore, even tho i can remember myself needing to somke a pack a day and it felt like i kinda absolutely had to.

To all of you who are struggling staying quit for only a few days or even hours.
I was at your point too. I tried to quit for **so** many times that i stopped counting. Around 50 times i guess.
I tried to quit for a year. Unsuccesful.

Don't tell yourself that you can't. 
I thought i was doomed to be a smoker my whole life.
I thought smoking was the depressing necessity of myself.

But know i fully realized that i am not a smoker.
I just had to prove it.

You don't need people to encourage you.

selftext: There's an unnerving irony that I became a smoker, starting in college, after my parents had quit so long ago after the doctor said "Your son has terrible asthma. You need to stop."

I grew out of the asthma and hated cigarettes. Always. If you asked me what led me to tolerate the shitty taste, I couldn't tell you. I know I was stressed and fucking up hard (oh those growing years in college), but I cannot remember the brain process that led to Yeah, smoking Newport Menthol 100s at a pack a day is totally what I want to do!"

I quit various times, only to fail. I quickly shifted from the Newports. Ran the gauntlet of cigs and their various social images. I was smoking around 3-4 a day on average towards the end this time. But I was fucking tired of it. I love running, I like being fit, I love cologne, I like smells. I was tired of compromising all of that.

So now it's 5 days. And I don't know if I'm compartmentalizing cravings away to a dark crevice of my brain, but it's not that paralytic. I associate cigs with situations rather than a release and I think that helped a lot. 

Been running 3.5/4 miles a day. Helps me see the benefit more than anything else. Glad my clothes smell good. Cleaned my car the fuck out, steam clean and everything.

The other day was a beautiful sunny Sunday - I had gotten off of work, was having a drink at a bar and around smokers. That's the fuckin shit right there, that's the cig I live for. If not right there, then driving home with some good music. But I resisted and was really happy I did. Glad to be done with cigs. Fuck 'Em.

selftext: Hi Guys,

I decided to quit a couple of weeks ago and yesterday was the day. I used to smoke a pack a day (24-26 in one in germany atm).
Today I have been spending a lot of time cleaning the apartment and doing some research for presentations and papers that are due the next couple of weeks.

My problem is, that I used to "reward" myself with a smoke after completing a task or doing some work for an hour or so and the few minutes after completing a task today were really hard. I was pacing around my flat, not knowing what to do...

How do you fill these little breaks you took throughout the day now that you quit? BTW also watched Allen Carrs Video thing, the reminding myself that I don't need it and I'm killing the nicotine monster wasn't really helping..

selftext:  I tried to quit smoking in March but couldn't deal with the extreme bitchiness and emotional breakdown that happened.  It was mid\-tax season.  

I decided to try again.  I haven't smoked in 20 hours.  I'm listless.  I'm emotional.  I'm just blah.  It finally clicked for me, though.  My SO that was quick to roll his eyes when I'd buy a pack of cigarettes for the past year \(I was going to quit last year and didn't\) hasn't really acknowledged my quit attempt.  He knows it's been 20 hours, which isn't a  long time.  But, for a 24 yr pack a day smoker, it's huge.

It finally dawned on me that one of the reasons I'm so emotional is that I need someone to tell me I'm doing a good thing.  Someone to give me an attagirl. Because this sucks.  It's hard.  I need someone to recognize that.  Maybe it's selfish of me.  But, dammit, I need it.

selftext: Hey so I've never posted on Reddit before but I found this sub and just reading through has been immensely helpful. I'm 23 years old and have been smoking since I was 16. I've tried to quit many times before using patches, lozanges, gum and welbutrin (which was awful for me). I began vaping two years ago and thought it was the best thing ever. I was able to cut my smoking down to just when I was really stressed or drinking. However I became even more reliant on nicotine than I was when I was smoking a pack a day. I felt like I needed at least a puff every 15 minutes or I'd go crazy, and I'd basically Chainsmokers the stupid thing whenever I could. Lowering the nictotine level made me just want more hits. Plus whenever the thingwould die or I'd run out of juice and have no way to get more I would just buy a pack and smoke. I decided to try chantix and I'm now ten days in on the medication and 3 with zero nictotine (haven't gone a day without it in atleast 4 years). The first few days were okay but today is just awful. I'm in the last few weeks of my undergraduate degree and I can't concentrate or focus on anything. My mind keeps telling me to take Adderall to get my work done but I know that would make it uncontrollable to smoke, and I worry about the interaction with chantix, which has been giving me lots of anxiety and depression, although that could just be art of the withdrawal. Does anyone have any tips that arnt just binge eating food and watching crappy tv and locking myself inside. I have no energy to excercise or really do anything, and my brain is going a 100 miles an hour inside my skull and all I want is for the fucking withdrawal to end and it's only been 3 days!!! I can feel my brain just screaming out for nicotine. Any tips or just kind words would be appreciated. I've quit other subtances before but this is a completely different animal.

selftext: I started smoking at 12 or 13, and by 16, I was smoking a pack a day. I continued smoking into my 30’s. I just turned 34 and am about to celebrate my first year of being cigarette free in over 20 years. I have done this by using a vape, so I am still using nicotine. I am personally OK with that. 

For me, vaping was the only method of quitting that worked. I tried prescription medication, patches, gum, and cold turkey. I know it’s not for everyone, but it does work for a lot of people.

My reason for this post was that I’m curious as to how others few vaping as a smoking cessation tool. Is it viewed as another tool in the arsenal or as cheating aka replacing the addiction with another?

selftext: I smoked for 10 years, in 5 hours time I will have hit the 4 day mark of not having a smoke, something I have not achieved in my countless previous quit attempts.

There are always interesting debates about quit methods, a lot of opinions say ‘Just quit’,  some people (who I admire and equally envy) can do this, however some can’t.

On Wednesday last week I bought an e-cig and liquids, I still had tobacco left, on Thursday I had one roll up on my way to work, and left two roll ups worth of
tobacco at home, that evening I got home had a beer and smoked my last two roll ups and from that point I have used nothing but the e-cig.

Obviously I’m still feeding my nicotine addiction, however it has been proven that vaping is at least 95% safer than smoking.

So I feel good about it, I haven’t had any troublesome cravings and already I’m starting to feel better as my body is beginning to expel the crap from my lungs.

Already my breathing is better, I no longer wheeze, I feel more energetic, the last 2 nights I have had a much better sleep than I can ever remember.  I no longer struggle to get up in the morning and I already feel physically and psychologically better... in just 4 days.

My commitment to myself is to get to my 30th birthday in September having rid myself of a habit and addiction that took control of my life.

Even if this means spending the next 12 months vaping, I will crank it down to zero nicotine when the time is right and then focus on gradually cutting down and eventually cutting out vaping all together.

This weekend has given me a lot of hope as I managed to do something I never thought possible...

I drank in the sun, partying with friends and surrounded by smokers on Friday and Saturday, however with the help of my e-cig I got through all of it relatively struggle free without touching a smoke.

As I write this I launch into another cough and yet more phlegm is cleared, it may be disgusting but it’s what we all have to do, just remember, each painful step is another step that you and your body is taking to clear out the badness that you’ve put in.

Now I have reached this point I know that I’m committed to it because I see the previous 3 days as an investment in my health, I’m not prepared to undermine that.

Remember that we are all stronger than those white sticks, you may need assistance or an NRT to break the tie of smoking, but there is a way out.

I will add that a girl asked me for a lighter for her cig, it felt great to say ‘I don’t have one, sorry’.

selftext: Like the title says, I have been tobacco free for 68 days. I used to dip and smoke and found out that the best way to stop would be to quit both cold turkey to purge my body of its addiction.  Nicotine addiction was described by Alan Carr as a feeling of hunger. Ever since I quit that craving hunger feeling hasn't fully gone away. It may have subsided a little bit but it's still there.  Anyone know if there's a time frame that it usually goes away?  Or is it just going to continue to very gradually get better until eventually it's gone? I don't plan on smoking or dipping even if the feeling stays. It would just be nice to be reassured that eventually it does pass.

I started smoking heavily at about 17, I'm currently 24 and was smoking anywhere from half to a full pack of Marlboro Red 100s a day and I am sick of it.

I work in sales so I can't imagine going cold turkey without losing my shit on a client and getting fired.

So far I'm down to 3 smokes a day and it has been managable so far and I'm planning on going to one per day then just being done completely but my question is how do you guys deal with the anger? 

Anytime I have a bad sales call my go to was running outside to have a smoke and calm down so now I need something to help me control my anger once I decide to be 100% done. 

I'm not interested in any nicotine substitutes I'm just going to be done completely in the next week or so.
If anyone has good tips on dealing with high stress and staying calm I'd love to hear it!

I’ve tried to stop smoking many times before and always picked one more up again a few days later, it’s an endless cycle that I’m ready to end. I’m serious this time. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. I just smoked the last one in my only pack about 45 minutes ago. I have many reasons to quit listed on my notes portion of my phone and I’ve downloaded the smoke free app(again). I smoke roughly 7-8 cigarettes per day and when I’m at work i only smoke during lunch,  the rest is all at home. In the past I’ve tried Chantix, patches, gum and lozenges. The longest I’ve gone without any nicotine in the past is 3 months. I’ve skimmed though Alan Carr’s easy way to quit in the past and I plan to ACTUALLY read it now. Anyways that’s a little bit of my story and I hope this community can help me achieve my goal.

After my last stint of six months, I didn’t have the urge, it was more out of habit that I asked the escort driving me back to get me a pack with my money I got from prison since they had my age and stuff. Ever since then which was a year ago, I’ve been smoking and haven’t been able to quit.   I’m a student at job corps and I told myself as my New Years resolution I would quit, and that didn’t happen. I hate it. I’m almost out of here and I want to be DONE with the orange booty cancer sucks for good so I can focus on my career in rap without bad breathing issues and whatnot plus no stink. I’ve tried nicotine patches and they don’t help. Please Reddit, I’m like begging for your help.

selftext: Hi, newly created account after lurking for a while.  11-year, 5-10/day smoker who quit by accident 17 days ago due to a trip I took with a group who didn’t know I was a smoker.  I’ve been careful about hiding it around a lot of people out of shame for years.  I figured I would do what I always do, and buy a pack on holiday and sneak out to smoke some, feeling guilty all trip, but I just didn’t?  I was able to chalk up my early quitting symptoms to jet lag, etc.  

Now that I am home, I am having a harder time than I did the first week!  Now that I *could* smoke whenever I want, I have to remind myself not to, constantly.  I feel like even my physical symptoms (cough, anxiety) are back just like they were the 2nd day!

Will this happen with every new triggering situation?  I imagine every first smoke-free concert, bonfire, drunken night out, heart to heart with my roommate in the garden, finals week... will remind me that I want to smoke, but when will the cigarettes loosen their grip???

I’m tired of being out of breath while not even doing anything. My girlfriend is sick and tired of our apartment smelling like smoke, although I smoke on the balcony a lot of the smoke gets in. I am also done with the feeling of having to buy a new pack while I could use the money for something much more reasonable.

The thing is, most of my quits have failed at the point I have nothing to do and I get really bored. That’s when the cravings really kick in. I could use some tips for these situations, the ”waiting for the craving to pass” -method hasn’t really been working for me...

I ended up buying two packs in addition to the cigarettes I bummed with others.. but promised to quit again after the week of vacation was over.. 
well, my throat was burned pretty bad and I’ve been hacking up disgusting and copious amounts of phlegm in the past four and a half days of quitting again. It’s reminding me of how awful smoking is. 
Thoughts of throat cancer are pretty persistent for me now. 
Anyway, I just felt like sharing this. It’s my first post here. I’m more of a social/binge smoker that can quit for a long time at random but once I get some triggers.. well , I fall for it. 
I’m hoping having some vague accountability will be helpful. I really want to make it to 5 months at least but we’ll see. 
I’m worried since I’ll see these smoker friends again in a few months. 
Any tips for me from fellow social smokers?

selftext: been smoking for 7 years. tried many times to quit before with varying success. a few times cold turkey, a few times with the patch, but I’ve never tried the gum. so far it’s working great and while occasionally the desire to smoke a cigarette is still there, it isn’t very strong. the gum at least stops me from having that complete freak out feeling that always makes me buy another pack when I try to quit. 

does anyone here have any success stories while using the gum? I’m worried because I don’t want to be addicted to nicotine at all. I’ve read stories of people who just keep chewing the gum for years and years. I want to be free from nicotine completely, especially since I’ve read a good amount of the Allen Carr book and I get it. I’m sure I’ll finish it one day soon and maybe that will help kick the gum, but much like the patch I know you’re supposed to finish the “cycle” completely for it to “work”. 

so I’m worried that if I cheat and try to stop early it won’t be effective and I’ll start smoking again. but I also don’t want to be chewing gum for like 4 months or for the rest of my life. even some days when I don’t feel I need a piece, I still try to reach that recommended daily amount of pieces used. 

either way it feels great to be almost a whole week without smoking a single cigarette. my body is already thanking me. my wallet is definitely thanking me. all I have to do is commit to never smoking a single cigarette again and I’ve got this!

selftext: I started smoking when I was 16, and smoked about 15 cigarettes a day until I was 29. I really saw it as part of my identity. Many times, it helped me make friends, kept me focused when I was drunk or stressed out.

I tried quitting a few times since I was 24 because I felt more and more guilty doing something so expensive, unhealthy and bad for the environment. My two aunts died of cancer and I felt really bad for my mother (who hates cigarettes because it killed her sisters). 

Sometimes quitting made me so depressed I decided I would rather die of cancer than live a whole life of despair. Sometimes when I quit, I would binge eat for weeks and hate myself. (And by the way, smoking again never made me lose the weight I gained during those attempts to quit).

One year ago, my lungs hurt so much that I thought it was too late for me : I had already fucked up my health. Instead of seeing as a battle against nicotine, I quit by letting go and trying to be honest with myself. I used nicotine patches in the beginning, and some lozenges after a few weeks. I never celebrated milestones, because I knew everytime I congratulated myself, I let my guard down a little bit. I don't get cravings often, but when I think I have won the war, they really surprise me and break me.

So, I have been really lucky to never fall in the trap of cravings again, for 365 days. I did gain weight, but I now exercise almost everyday and I feel better about myself. A huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

My wish for the next year is to stay humble about the process. I'm doing well but I could go back to smoking very fast if think I'm above the addiction. 

Still, today, for one day, I will let myself be fucking proud. I didn't think I was capable of quitting. The thought of living without smoking used to make me panic instantly. And still, I lived a whole year without one cigarette. I feel strong instead of weak. Bravo, me!

A few tips I learned through experience, in case it can save time to others : 

- Psyllium Fibre in caps saved me from bloating and constipation. I still had problems in that department for the first 2-3 weeks. It gets better. 

- I'm not sure if the effects are real but I took a lot of St. John's wort pills when I quit. I believe it helped my brain. I smoked for so long and started when my brain wasn't completely formed, so I thought maybe I wasn't capable of creating my own happiness hormones. I don't know if St. John's wort helped but I want to believe. Mentally, I feel OK now, phew!

- I didn't avoid bars and alcohol for too long. I was quitting to be happier, not sad and alone. But I allowed myself to leave the party early if I felt drunk of craving a cigarette. I was just being kind to myself and it worked!

I would like to tell you about my first smoke free day. It's really weird because I thought it would be a lot harder. At the beginning of this week I thought I just start smoking less before I quit for good, I really struggled and craved for cigarettes a lot.

This Wednesday evening I made the decision and said to myself, I'm a non smoker, I don't want to smoke I loose nothing if I quit but gain so much.

I've read that the first three days are the hardest, but I was surprised how easy it felt for me. Okay I'm only half way through my second day, but I feel good and confident I don't really struggle at the moment. The cravings are not as hard as I thought, it's like something clicked in my head.. Did anyone experience something similar? (I don't mean to offend anyone who struggles harder, I wish you good luck, you can do it)

I've never really given quitting my all even though I've wanted to. I just feel it's time to grow up and stop blowing money on it. I smoke about a pack every 5-7 days, so it's not as bad as it could be. I just finished the spring semester in college and have a few weeks before I start my summer job around coworkers who are chain smokers, so I want to have a few weeks of no smoking under my belt before I go back to that environment.

I'm not a regular here, though I have browsed this sub in the past, and I consider you my people, and you all have my respect and compassion. I quit smoking cold turkey 4 years ago today. I quit right before my 27th birthday, after smoking about half a pack a day for 10 years. I loved and hated smoking. I'd tried to quit using nicotine gum a few times but always backslid. When I finally did it, I had the advantage of moving across the country and away from my old habits and triggers. That helped immensely. 

Quitting has made my life so much better. I'm no longer shackled to an addiction. Once my mom asked what the hardest part was and I said "the first six months." There was a time when I felt I would always have this addiction haunting me and that I'd never be able to quit. I can't believe it's been four years. 

This may be the hardest thing you'll ever do, but it is SO worth it. If you can white\-knuckle your way through those first few days, weeks and months, you'll be rewarded with a sense of smell \(!!\) and a sense of freedom you can only imagine now. If you fall off the wagon, get back on! Good luck everyone! Feel free to message me if you want to talk.

Cravings pretty much nonexistent, which I’m suprised of cause I used to smoke a pack a day.

selftext: I quit smoking one month ago after smoking 6-8 per day for a year. I had read Allen Carr's book and for a month I felt amazing, with only a few cravings here and there that I was able to overcome with minimal effort. Today, however, I had a terrible craving and instead of waiting for it to go away (which it would have in 10 minutes), I rushed outside and bought a pack. I was feeling depressed because I have finals going on and they aren't going as well as I had hoped, and I just really wanted a sweet sweet cigarette to take the pain away. When I took the first puff, I realized I wasn't enjoying it. After a month of no smoke in my lungs, that first puff felt like I was inhaling toxic fumes from a factory sewer or something. That is where I should have stopped, but instead I forced myself to finish the cigarette in the hopes that it would make me feel better. It didn't, and I felt even shittier by the time it was done. I did throw away the pack and the lighter right there and then, but I feel like the damage has been done. I have broken my streak, even though I had promised to myself I'd never put a cancer stick in my mouth ever again. I guess this is just a rant.

Ever since vaping came to be, I used that method, gradually reducing to 0 nic level.  I found it useful, but I still would screw up and smoke after a few months.  

I lost my vape setup on a recent trip.  I've decided not to replace it.  I was vaping 0 nicotine anyway, and I feel like it's time to break all ties to the habit of smoking.  I ordered some fancy organic breath spray that I'm going to spray into my mouth when I have intense cravings.  It tastes better than cigarettes for sure.

This week has been a bit rough from a few factors, and for 3 days or so I've been getting a lot of cigarette cravings. Some of them are kinda intense, my brain's old go to method to deal with negative emotions like this.

I think this is one of my deepest craving triggers. I will not smoke but it's kind of crazy how powerful the pull is. They last for about 10-30 seconds. I know why I quit and I don't ever want to become a smoker again, but I would like for this to go away.

To those just quitting... it's way easier than you think it could ever be, but it's never free.

selftext: I've been having a rough go of it. I read Alan Carr's book, I tried Chantix, tried hypnotism, meditation, positive thinking the whole lot. I've gotten myself 25 days along but I started having serious psychological issues from the Chantix. So I went off the Chantix which didn't go well  and was causing horrible panic attacks today. I couldn't quite figure out if this was a result of going off the medication or if this is just what quitting smoking without medication feels like. Somebody handed me a cigarette, and just holding it made the panic subside. I didn't smoke it, when I realized but the Panic slow down I realized I didn't have to smoke again. I did get zero nicotine Vape to bridge me between coming off the Chantix and being fully ready to be a non-smoker. Maybe it's a pacifier But I'm happy that I didn't cave and reintroduce nicotine to my system after almost a month. I really wish I could have been the kind of person the Allen Carr talks about in his book that just walked away and enjoyed it or whatever, but I'm not that person. The idea of feeling like this every day for the rest of my life honestly freaked me out. So you're if you're at this place and and you can't make your subconscious live up to the same standard other people seem to be able to do, Maybe you don't want to use a replacement but also don't be afraid to use a replacement if you need to. One method doesn't work for everybody. I don't know if this helps anybody but it helped me today.

selftext: This is the 1st time I didn't go for any nicotine replacements because I wanted to say NO not just to smoking, all forms of nicotine.
After 12 days, today few minutes earlier I experienced a craving. Just walking out of office and typing this message kept me busy and I am so glad that I did overcome that urge!
