A very particular fear of mine could pass as moderate, but the reasons and thought process leading up to the fear are rather complex and bother some, so I'm gong to rate it as severe.\nI have a few categories for this fear as well, which Im going to break down. WARNING: You may judge me.\nAnyways here it is:\n1. The fear of people judging my intelligence.\n2. The fear of actually being incompetent/lacking potential \n\nSounds stupid huh? Let me explain myself.\n\nMost things about to me, regardless of what it's related to, tend to be misunderstood or have complex reasons behind them. I'm a difficult person to truly get to know, and in specific ways have a rather complex personality. \nThis is one of the reasons Im terrified of IQ test. If I had a low score people would simplify my problems, and pass everything off as just related to a disability. Even IF I did score bad (I don't know what my real score is), that wouldn't be the reason for the majority of things related to me. \nI. AM. MORE. COMPLEX. THEN. THAT.\nSo that's one reason, people simplifying my problems to the core and missing the other traits.\n\n-----------------\n\nAnother reason it bothers me for people to judge it is because they don't have all the information.\nI have a family member with schizophrenia, and most educated people know it's more then just hallucinating and believing shit. He also has a speech impediment.\nDue to the fact I have a family member with this illness, I highly suspect I may have a mild form of it. Mainly because I share mild traits in common with the disorder, especially having speech issues.\nIn some ways it actually depends, because I LITERALLY go in a pattern between having really good speech and having shit speech. It CHANGES.\n\nRegardless of my very decent speech sometimes most people have encountered me with a bad speech impediment because Im more prone to it in the same environments I develop derealization. As a result, I tend to look ways I don't actually think. A lot of people I know have narrow perspective of things and believe everyone with communication difficulties is unintelligent. I can prove that perspective wrong, since the impaired relative I know scored high on the IQ test.\n\nThe reason I don't bring up mental illness while describing my reasons is because I screwed myself over in the past. If you want me to be truly honest, I've been diagnosed with high functioning autism during my early teen years. As a result of it, I got overly preoccupied with the diagnosis and blasted social media at one point because I always felt different and had the extreme urge for everyone to understand me. If I tell people it might of been wrong and the symptoms are probably a result of psychosis, they're going to think Im an idiot.\n\n--------------------\n\nThe other reason it bothers me so badly is because I have an uncontrollable perception. Throughout my childhood and teen years I've envisioned myself becoming a zoologist or getting involved in psychology. If it turns out I'm not actually good enough for my interest or career plans, I would probably have a huge cow. Im somewhat emotionally attached to the way I see myself in the future and fear I am not actually good enough for this world. Im currently a cartoon artist (which is my biggest hobby throughout my life), but want to get involved in OTHER things AS WELL.\nIm not going to lie, I don't know everything about biology or animals, but I used to own several animal books during my childhood and enjoyed learning about the categories and facts about those animals. But the knowledge I possess on animals is SUPER easy. \nAs a child I was obsessed with learning about animals, and I believe I can gain my knowledge back and perhaps learn more advanced info.\nI also took a strengths and weaknesses test in high school that told me I would do great at biology.\n\nRegardless of all that, I still possess the fear I may not be good enough for my goals or career plans, and that I'm not actually meant for anything better in this world.\nI enjoy perceiving myself as a character that may be complete bullshit as well, which just adds up to the possibility. \nI also imagine people perceiving me as the career plans I identify with. A cartoonist type of character who enjoys learning about mental illnesses and is into zoology. My inner world is EVERYTHING and I NEED to live up to my ideals.\n\n------------------------\n\nIt may seem like my fears are slightly narcissistic in a way.... But if it actually does turn own I have potential or a decent IQ level, I think Id actually become an even better person. I won't necessarily boast about it, but would probably tell a lot of people so they avoid judgment or are better capable of understanding me as an individual.\n\nSo to shorten it all out:\n\n#1 I'm a pretty complex individual who's misunderstood on so many levels, and possess the fear people will link my problems to all the unknown answers.\nLike, people believing they have all the reasons to my problems specifically because of the results, or missing the coincidences (As I said earlier, I don't know my real IQ).\n^^^^^^\nsorry for the shitty way I explained that lel.\n\n#2 Im highly concerned with accuracy, and can't tolerate people believing I'm thinking of nothing when in reality my thoughts are racing. I imagine things most people don't realize and think through a lot, REGARDLESS of what my actual range is.\n\n#3 Sometimes I genuinely don't feel good enough, and worry a lot about lacking potential. I don't want my world to crash down on me.\nI would no longer have the ability to daydream without imagining scenarios related to my idiocy. \n\n#4 I care about specific people on a super very high level, and would die if they perceived me as an idiot. I don't even care if they view me as average intellect, I just don't want the reputation of being incompetent by the people I love so much.\n\n#5 Im pretty sure there's other reasons it bothers me to, but I need to get some sleep. Also, the fact I posted this during a state of going too long without it is the reason I may stop including extra info for now. If somebody replies I may talk to them later.\nSorry if I wrote anything stupid, was tired while typing it down.

I have some odd symptoms, and my biggest concern is sleeping and a few others. \n\nI am also diagnosed with PTSD and have been experiencing derealization disorder for a year straight. I have some symptoms that im not sure if theyre particular to anything I suffer from, or if theyre the onset of my moms schizophrenia. \n\nI can go to bed at 12 AM and wake up at 10 AM and I won't feel refreshed at all. It's worry me cause of course theres more information on fatigue with schizophrenia then there is with anxiety/depression and fatigue. Of course if you ask a therapist, they say Oh yeah it can be caused by anxiety. I just wanted to know if any of you experience fatigue like this, it will reassure me greatly. \n\nI guess the other big symptom I have is paranoia, but whenever I take a paranoid personality quiz it says I don't have one. I'm not paranoid over everyone though. \n\n\nI have only been told two times that I was acting irritational. One time I was in the middle of the woods with my friend and there was a man sitting on a tree stump. He saw us and stood up. I said to my friends \"lets go the other way\" and I started speed walking. They told me to chill. The fact they were freaking out makes me feel like I have something wrong with me, but on the other hand there was literally a man sitting in the middle of the woods and he got up when he saw us.\n\nThe other time I walked to a food store with my friend at 3 AM. The food store was closed, but there were like one or two cars in the parking lot. A sketchy looking lady got out of her car and started walking towards us. I started walking the opposite direction fast. My friend told me to calm down. This again made me feel like something was wrong with me.\n\n\nI think it's worth noting Im flinchy and have an extreme startle response, but I wasnt abused. I was around my alcoholic father who would go on rampages and I didnt feel like the enviroment was safe. Im wondering if the two things I listed could be contributed to PTSD, or are actually normal signs of paranoia. In both situations I thought it was justified to be sketched out, especially the worst one.

Also sorry if some things aren't properly explained, English is not my first language.\n\nMy [18F] mother [57F] has been struggling with dementia for 3 years; she used to work as a high school teacher and now works as a sort of secretary in the same school, however recently (meaning a month at most) she has been showing growing signs of schizophrenia and paranoia: at first she thought some students were shouting insults and profanities at her in the corridors, then that another secretary, who is undoubtedly a nasty person, was inciting this behaviour and also following her home and talking badly about her to the neighbours. It started with her only hearing voices, but lately she told us that she saw this secretary in our driveway or on the bus (yes her driver's license also got suspended, and she has never really gotten over it, understandably). \n\nSo my father brought her to a doctor two weeks ago, who diagnosed her with schizophrenia (but without telling her) and prescribed her meds \"for anxiety\"; at first she refused to take them no matter what we said, but then all of a sudden she decided to start the therapy. However, things only escalated from there: she started seeing things more often, accusing my father of having an affair with the secretary (he has never even met her), telling me she doesn't trust him anymore and what's worse she started talking to herself from time to time, saying things like \"go away!\" or \"leave me alone!\"\n\nNow I really don't understand how the pills could possibly have made her condition worse, I suspect she's maybe taken them once or twice and has been throwing them away ever since. Also she's convinced she's perfectly sane and that we, her own family, are against her and lying when we gently try to explain that maybe she's just confusing a few things. Honestly I'm really worried about her chances of improvement if she keeps thinking all of this is real, and also that she'll start talking about these things at work, so in the end my question is: how should I behave when she talks to me about her delusions? \n\nShould I try to gently make her reason like I've been doing until now? Should I just go along with it or avoid the matter entirely (I suppose this is the worst course of action, but then again I'm really at a loss here)? Should I go straight to the point and tell her it's all in her head, make her look up schizophrenia and insist she should see a therapist (though honestly if she doesn't want to it's not like we can force her)?

Almost each day at school I worry people might be talking about me behind my back, one time I was walking and I heard these 2 girls from my class talking, I wasn't paying attention before, but I heard one of them say  \"be quiet, he might hear us\" and the other girl responded saying \"well, I want him to hear us\". I thought they were talking about me as I was one of the only few people around and I was a male too. I started worrying that they might be talking about me, but I also have been worrying I might be developing schizophrenia for the past 5 months and I thought I might be delusional (not hallucinating because I saw them go on the bus) and after this thought I had a panic attack. Could this be social anxiety or am I delusional? I didn't truly believe they were 100% plotting against me or something, but that they were possibly talking about me. Ever since that day I've had other similar occurances and worried people are talking about me behind my back. Although, I wouldn't say I was worried, just concerned and maybe a bit suspicious that people are talking about me. In fact, if I see someone laughing or talking to someone else while they're looking at me, I worry they might be talking about me.  Does anyone else get this?

Just hear me out:\n\nIt started when 5 months ago when I got these random images that appeared in my mind's eye (imagination) and since then I have had several different symptoms (I no longer get the images). But these \"auditory hallucinations\" have been quite consistent, they started about 2-3 months ago. They usually say random sentences or phrases,  and the \"voices\" are sometimes in my friend's/family's voice or mine. Sometimes they can say stuff that is loosely associated with what I'm thinking about and sometimes they never finish their sentences and are just completely unintelligible and just mumble it in the background. Also music gets stuck in my head too. Sometimes they say  stuff I've heard before earlier on in the day, they usually happen during the day, (but I don't get them while I'm in school though) when there's lots of noise or when I'm trying to go to sleep. I know they aren't real and I know they are in my mind, they feel like they're in the back of my mind and I try to ignore them. They don't say anything bad (usually) and they don't command me to do anything, also there isn't multiple of them at once, they just kinda pop in my head at random times. They used to happen occurringly but now they seem to be happening more frequently and I worry I may be detoriating (but it could be because I'm worrying and obsessing about them, therefore they become worse). I also worry I may be delusional because I worry that people might be talking about me behind my back, for example, I was in school and I saw these group of girls looking at me and giggling and talking to each other, I worried they might be talking about me. (However it could very well be my anxiety as I wasn't 100% certain they were talking about me) and I spent the rest of the day obsessing over this and worrying. I'm going to tell my parents about this, and I'm gonna tell them to see a psychiatrist, I've wanted to before but I've never actually had the nerve to do it.

Like, I genuinely believed my dog was a robot and an informant for my parents when I was 13, I thought people could read my mind till I was about 15, I thought my neighbours were spying on me through my windows till i was about 8, etc. And I thought it was all gone, but then a few months ago it started coming back kinda slowly, then *very* rapidly. So after parkland (not to make a tragedy about me) i started being paranoid at school and I have a delusion that I know is a delusion but also fully believe? if that makes sense, that I will be the next victim of a school shooting which I kinda don't care but kinda really care cause I don't want those around me to be injured/killed either? and like I think all my teachers are treating me differently when they clearly aren't but i still believe it? except for one teacher who i thought was treating me better and i didn't even know it was a delusion until a few days ago when i was reading about various delusions of grandeur and i realised it wasn't him treating me better, that he treated everyone the same and that fucked me up because now i don't know if i have other delusions or whatever the fuck they are that i fully believe as reality that are actually really sick and fucked up and not real?? and I've started hallucinating for what I believe to be the first time, but it's mild, like hearing my parents call me downstairs, hearing/feeling my phone go off in my pocket, seeing figures at the end of the sidewalk, etc. all of which aren't happening/aren't there.

I started my journey thinking NoFap will give me a jumpstart in achieving my goals by giving me mental clarity and energy and yes it did give me all these superpowers that were an alien of a concept for me for about 3 to 4  years since I've started watching porn, now I know this time is not even close to the time you guys have been watching porn, but I feel worse than you guys because watching porn started a chain of bad habits in me. I ate one meal a day, slept for 5 or 6 hours, surfed the internet for 20 hours, stayed in a room for weeks, started looking like a vampire because I didn't go outside, had no communication with others, the internet was my world.  I feel  like I have reached a deep end where if I even masturbate for once  I will cum my brains out, its has affected me greatly I have become an outcast classmates literally call me mad guy because I argue with every person that I come across I start to have pointless debates with everyone, including teachers, to the point where no teacher likes me because every time I argue they can't come up with suitable arguments, not because my arguments were irrefutable but because I did't let them, I wanted attention, I didn't want them to win. You may be thinking I am digressing but stay with me I'm not, all of this over thinking started when I started to watch porn on a  daily basis I had a hunch that something is wrong but I couldn't come up with solutions to stop this addiction, days, weeks, years, past and by then I had already become a wretched  man shackled by his addiction. I started to have existential crises as I started to question everyday things, feelings, beliefs, that's where I started to go haywire I argued with everyone I didn't care who it was I bashed them. Now I was born a Muslim and you guys know what kind of extremists Muslims are, I can't control my tongue or thoughts, close friends started to tell me to keep my mouth shut because of what they would do to me if I kept questioning Islam and its culture and traditions, I know what these butchers have done to people who have inquired. I'm not against Islam or any other religion.I'm against people who can't think for themselves. \n\nMy NoFap journey started when I saw a Fapstronaut on YouTube talking about the pros of not watching porn and discovered all these awesome NoFap communities, books, websites, science behind pornography and I started to read every book and watch every video, today I don't think there is any article or video on internet that I haven't watched or read about pornography, I embedded it into my subconscious, I became so terrified of its effects that for 20 days I couldn't  get my penis erect, today I am on day 35, so here is the real problem, internet is filled with erotic images, they are bound to be seen even if you resist with all your might, I taught my brain to not watch porn to the point where even when I have wet dreams and a girl is twerking her ass at me, I tell myself to not be seduced or trapped which I will regret latter. Now I think my brain is hard\\-wired to not watch porn. But when I do see an erotic image on the internet my subconscious thinks there's a lion about to attack me, my fight/flight response gets activated. It has been 4 days since my anxiety has sky rocketed, my flight/fight response has been not turned off for the past several days I have such insomnia where I have to lie for 5 hours in the bed then fall asleep only to wake up after 12 hours and still be tired like shit, my heartbeat has not\\-so\\-normal rhythm, I feel like someone is pinching nails into my whole body, I constantly sweat, the worse part is I have feelings of going completely nuts like a mental breakdown, where I will be put in an asylum and that will be the end of me, I have constant suicidal thoughts. I perpetually think I have a serious mental illness like Schizophrenia, Bipolar, ADHD, or some fatal virus. I'm asking for help because mental illnesses are not much of a big deal here and we don't have many psychiatrists or psychologists. Unlike you guys my problem is completely different, I didn't start NoFap to treat my ED, I just wanted to be sane again.

Used to have a 4.0 in high school, honors classes, etc. until about a year and a half ago when I began getting these thoughts in my head that I can't shake. Every single day, I feel more and more like the things and people around me are not real. My mind feels clouded and most of the time it's hard to think. These two things seem to go hand in hand. The harder it is to think, the less my mind seems to be able to handle the outside world and everything gets... far away. Almost like I'm outside myself but at the same time I have control. This is usually accompanied by anxiety, caused by the feelings and thoughts themselves which only serves to make it all worse. At first it started off as a light issue, something I could handle but couldn't make much sense of. As time went on the problem grew.. and grew... and grew.. and suddenly it was an all day, every day thing. I used to have some solace in the mornings, some time I felt \"normal\", and by midday it would start. Now that's completely regressed and it never ends..\n\nNights are the worst. Evening/nighttime is when I get even more lethargic and out of it, and my mental capacity decreases even further, to the point that I just end up sitting at my desk or in my bed, not really doing anything because everything is hard when I have to fight these thoughts and feelings in my head. I've never had a complete mental breakdown; I've always kept it together even in the worst of times. I comfort myself by thinking of my family, of times before all this when I was normal and my mind was comprehending things in a normal way. Sometimes it's hard to even react to things people do or say because my mind can't just automatically process things anymore like it used to. I often have to think about what just happened to really get it. My memory has taken quite a hit as well.. I used to be able to remember conversations to the letter, but now I sometimes forget they even happened.\n\nIf anyone out there has any experience with this... or anything like it.. please let me know your thoughts on what it is or how to deal with it.. because at this point I just don't know what to do.

The past couple of weeks he seems completely out of touch with reality and I don't know what's going on with him. We are both self employed in the same business, up until about a year ago his business was thriving. He was always a shy overweight guy and confidence was a big of an issue, but otherwise I never saw signs of mental illness.\n\nLast year he started slacking off on the business end, getting very spendy and not working hard enough to keep up that lifestyle. Smoking weed a LOT, like 3-5+ times a day every day. I know he also used cocaine at least some but I have no idea the real extent of it. Going on road trips all over the country, just basically selling off all of his store's inventory and blowing through the money. He was constantly hitting me up to buy his inventory at wholesale prices because he just blew through money. He's now run out of assets and stopped paying bills, just got \"evicted\" and couldn't be bothered to move his stuff out but instead drove to NYC (from Texas) and is sleeping in his car. Even before when he lived in his house he wasn't showering regularly. \n\nUp until recently I thought he had a problem with drugs. But now he's really gone off the deep end and I'm wondering if it's something more. This morning he called me at 730am and just ranted and rambled for 45 minutes about nonsensical delusions. After 10min I muted my microphone and put it on speaker while I got ready &amp; showered, me not saying anything back didn't make him skip a beat. He explained how it's his employee's fault his business failed, that his dad is actually a drug lord trying to hide in a middle class facade, that he himself is a ghost writer for Drake, Big Sean, etc. He says he's flying to Pakistan to meet some execs for a clothing company, that he's friends with CEOs of Loreal and Paul Mitchell and he's doing business with them. He's won a Grammy award but declined it because Robin Williams told him not to become famous before he committed suicide. His uncle tried to kill him on a road trip after they got into an argument. He's got millions of dollars in trust funds but he just can't access it right now. His dad raised him to be submissive and quiet and he's the reason he's fat. There was just so much said and it was all just rambling, repeating the same things multiple times, saying things that didn't lead anywhere, etc. He also claims he had himself tested for mental illnesses in Seattle, San Antonio, and another city I can't recall because schizophrenia runs on one side of his family but that's the first I've ever heard of it. Why he'd be tested 3 times in a year I have no idea, and I'm doubting that happened at all. \n\nHe wholeheartedly believes all of this, though. He's dropped random parts of these stories here and there, plus I've heard from mutual friends that he's said the same things over the past month or so. I tried to be as non confrontational as possible and said he isn't making sense and I'm worried about him, he took it as an insult and got angry that I was calling him a liar. Turns out he texted my girlfriend afterwards and said he was upset that I \"thought he was crazy\". Spoke to him again and he told me to lose his number because he knows I'll never trust him again. He says I called him a liar twice and I'm taking the side of his old employee against him (I never even mentioned his employee to him whatsoever) and \"if I call him a liar a 3rd time we'll have a problem\". I didn't reply at that point and an hour later he came back asking for $500 offering to give me everything he has left in his store (which he values at $50k, but he literally owns nothing but shelving anymore) \n\nTL;DR since I know I just wrote an essay -\n\nFriend threw his business away. Heavy marijuana use and at least come cocaine. Major delusions, ranting and rambling. Stopped showering regularly. Claims he has a family history of schizophrenia, but was tested and he's OK. Constantly says \"I know everyone thinks I'm crazy or a crackhead but I'm not\". Seems to just drive around the country aimlessly sleeping in his car or at campsites. \n\n\nI'm no mental health expert but what else does this sound like? I thought it might have been cocaine (or other drug use I don't know about) that was making him delusional but today the exact second that he mentioned being tested for schizophrenia it was like a light bulb that went off in my head and it explains so much. I don't want to make an amateur diagnosis but from people more familiar with mental illnesses, what does this sound like to you? And more importantly, how can I help him without insulting him and having him just cut me off or pushing him further away? To those who read through this long essay, thank you so much. Any advice is very much appreciated.

Probably the big one was caring for my terminally ill mother, and my 9 year old sister, when I was 18. Having to force aside my teenage awkwardness and bathe my own mum, or hold her hand as the doctor tells her she's only got a few months left, or tearfully tell her you can't give her a lethal dose of her morphine to end her pain like she's asking you to do. Or find some way to comfort my lost little sister who just doesn't understand why her mum had to leave her behind. A few years later my then-partner had a miscarriage, and I lost the one child I've ever conceived. \n\nObviously all that (and more!) left behind some fairly serious psychological scarring, but I shouldered it and carried on as best as I could, trying to be a decent person and never once letting on to (nearly) anyone else about the internal hell I was living in. Why? Hard to say. A deep fear of judgement, a general sense of distrust, and a dysfunctional relationship with my very dysfunctional family, are probably my best guesses.\n\nThat's two decades of privately dealing with unspeakable anguish and utter despair, and a frantic urge to kill myself that never really goes away. With my mask of normalcy on, I was very high functioning; I was great at my job, went and got an honours degree in nanotechnology, had loving relationships and many wonderful friends who would do anything for me, and I was a favourite brother and a idolised uncle of 10 amazing nephews and nieces. But behind the mask I was (and am) a slow motion train wreck.\n\nBut as the decades have gone by, the mask has become too heavy to hold anymore. Things went from bad to worse. I stopped being functional, and my career just stopped. Eventually I had myself committed to a psychiatric hospital for a week. The one person I ever confided in, my ex-girlfriend and eternal best friend, picked me up from the hospital and finally got me to agree to telling my family. This was literally about 10 days ago. Hearing my diagnosis, the severity of it and the decades of private suffering has rocked my family, and I've been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. I'm probably more miserable right now because I'm embarrassed and ashamed (even writing this has taken me about two hours because it's so hard to discuss), but there's definitely some relief there too. Every night I've had long talks with different family members, which leave me emotionally drained. My sister has taken me into her home, and although I'm filled with anxiety, sadness and fear every day about inflicting myself upon her and her family, the upside is that my little niece and nephew give me so much love and hugs every day, and sometimes it makes me so happy that I feel tears running down my face. I don't deserve such pure unconditional love.\n\nI hope there's a happy ending to this. I've got plans to move to a beautiful part of the world to live and work with some wonderful friends who are supportive of my condition. At least now I can be more open with my family, although that alone isn't going to fix my bad brain chemistry. And now my best friend can share the load of picking up the pieces of me when I break. But I know it's going to take serious lifestyle changes to break free of the worst of it, and I'm not sure if I'll ever find the peace I want. \n\nMoral of the story: be open about your mental health, to both your family and friends.

This sounds pedantic, of course. But I do. I have the kind of musical taste that figures as \u201chigh IQ taste\u201d in academic studies. Taste correlates with IQ. A man who is acquainted with the literature of William Gaddis and John Ashbery will also be acquainted with the music of Steve Reich and Arvo Part. If he happens to be a millenial, Twin Peaks will probably be his favorite TV show, and he will probably also like lowbrow media such as anime and video games.\n\nI\u2019m fascinated with how refined niche tastes can get. In 4chan\u2019s retro gaming forum you will find intelligent millenials who are well-versed not only in Final Fantasy and Streets of Rage, but who can also discuss the libraries of forgotten consoles like Amiga or rank games of subterranean subgenres such as edutainment and visual novels. Head over to the music forum and you meet with connoisseurs of dream pop, shoegaze, italian prog, extreme metal, the list is endless. There is something particularly masculine about this exploratory inclination, this taste for obscure games and obscure music. The adventurousness of unearthing gems in garage sales and record shops or through peer-to-peer software like Soulseek.\n\nI think we can call this adventurous taste an \u201caristocratic\u201d taste. Curiosity, ambition. Sifting through forgotten artifacts. There\u2019s a dignity to it. Maybe \u201cagency\u201d is the word. Agency as opposed to the placid consumer passivity of having Spotify hand you an algorhytmically generated playlist or of buying \u201cspecial offers\u201d on Steam. In short, \u201cpatrician\u201d taste is adventurous; \u201cplebeian\u201d taste is passive. Soulseek is emblematic of the former, Spotify of the later. \n\nThis patrician taste crops up everywhere in the world. Enter a Soulseek chatroom and there you find people from America, Finland, Canada, France, Spain, Germany, Argentina, Brazil.\nUsually, yes, first-world countries. Taste depends on civilization. Small bands will usually tour America, Europe and Japan. America is affluent. Europe and Japan have the most charming architecture. It is no coincidence that these places of high civilization are the places where there is a natural aristocracy, an aristocracy that downloads music from Soulseek and patronizes the concerts of small but respected touring musicians. Latin Americans and Africans have internet connections too, but you don\u2019t see a comparable flowering of good taste there, and probably that is, to a large extent, why bands don\u2019t venture much to these places. Places like Cuba are simpy off-limits; bands couldn\u2019t play there even if they wanted to. So communism, too, has something to do with it. But it\u2019s not stricly a political issue. It seems that totalitarianism ruins not only economies, but also the imagination.\n\nOf course, maybe I\u2019m not entirely right. I live in Brazil and there are many hipsters here. (I hate the word hipster but it will have to do.) But there are very few good bands here. I don\u2019t know exactly why. It\u2019s something in the air. We croak under a Leviathan of big state and big business, under a byzantine bureaucracy and monolithic monopolies. Our tax rates are beyond all decency. But we are also spiritually undernourished.\n\nBut this universal pattern of taste seems indeed to be an observable pattern. There isn\u2019t much difference between a hipster in New York and in Stockholm or Barcelona or Tokyo. They will like the same music, the same authors, the same filmmakers. They\u2019re in the same wavelenght. The point is the taste. This flowering of taste that appears in civilized places. There is everywhere a caste of natural aristocrats. This doesn\u2019t sound very Christian, yes. Chesterton remarked on this. The idea of \u201ccastes\u201d is not Christian. But there is such a thing as natural aristocrats and we might as well call them a caste.\n\nPeople from this caste arise even in distant, despised suburbs. They have slightly different facial features, speak in a slightly different way, score higher on IQ tests. Yes, pride is the worst sin, and dwelling too much on what sets us apart from our neighbors is maybe not very good. But I have to do it for the purposes of this post. There is such a thing as this caste, and it has certain physical and spiritual features, and it tends to have, universally, everywhere in the world, the same taste. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The flowering of talent**\n\nI grew up in a Mennonite neighborhood in Curitiba, a capital in southern Brazil. I went to a Mennonite church and studied at a Mennonite school. Most people in that neighborhood are of pure German descent. Well, this is changing lately, a lot of Mennonites are marrying outside their race. I\u2019m one of the forerunners of this dillution of the Mennonite blood. My mother is of pure German descent; my father is Italian, Portuguese and Native American. But well, I will not discuss this touchy topic here. \n\nBut those Mennonite guys have pretty German taste. My cousin was obsessed with Dream Theater. He and other German guys and my sister (as a bassist) had a band for a while. Metal, too, some guys in the neighborhood \u2014 \u201cat church\u201d, I was going say, or \u201cat school\u201d, but it really is an old-fashoned neighborhood where everyone lives nearby and goes to the same school and to the same few local churches \u2014 were deeply into metal. And is it any coincidence that it is Norway of all countries that is most famous for its metal bands? That dark German neuroticism, that gave us men like Luther and Nietzsche, isn\u2019t metal its musical form? But the point is this: it\u2019s in their DNA. I remember going to church and seeing my cousins and sister play during worship, and this was a pretty \u201ccharismatic\u201d church, mind you. In fact my cousin is now a pastor. But they were into prog and metal. \n\nThis phenomenon of Mennonite teens, in a charming Mennonite neighborhood lined with trees where you might easily find someone\u2019s Plautdietsch-speaking grandmother taking a walk, these teens mostly of pure German descent, playing progressive metal riffs at church during a weekday rehearsal: this is a beautiful, natural flowering of talent. It is universal, too; I bet similar things happened in other Mennonite communities worldwide. And this happened because, though these Mennonites were serious Christians, they were not excessively puritanical. They didn\u2019t frown on rock music. And their penchant for prog metal, this particular niche, with its vast and somewhat somber musical vistas: it\u2019s a genetic penchant. Spiritual proclivities are also genetic. (Indeed I believe there is more to \u201cgenes\u201d, to \u201cheritability\u201d, than mere petty instincts. I believe that there is more to evolution than mere materialistic darwinism.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Deliverance ministry**\n\nYes, here we enter into the deliverance ministry part of the post. I have read too much about this subject. I wish I hadn\u2019t. I wish I didn\u2019t know as much about it as I do. I can name names, names of authors who have written on the subject: Bob Larson. Derek Prince. Malachi Martin. Conrad Murrell. Protestant authors and Catholic authors. \n\nIt\u2019s frightening to read about it. Not because of the nature of the subject. But because the more one reads about it, the more undeniably real you realize it is. The same patterns appear again and again. Whether the deliverance minister lives in Texas or in Rome, he will face the same demons: demons of lust, demons of witchcraft, Jezebel spirits. The same names, even the same legions, the same \u201cdemon groupings\u201d, will appear in the reports of different authors. The same strange behaviors of spirits, too: the spite, the insolence, the swearing, the hatred of Jesus and of anything holy, the strange illogical behavior (such as saying \u201cI\u2019m not here\u201d when the exorcist asks if they\u2019re there).\n\nIndeed if you go the website of the St. Padre Pio Deliverance Counseling ministry, you will find that they draw from Protestant deliverance ministries. These Catholics who engage in exorcism acknowledge the efficacy of Protestant exorcisms. If you read the website it reads very much like a Protestant deliverance ministry website. Yes: exorcism unites Protestants and Catholics. Scott Peck, famous author of \u201cThe road less travelled\u201d (a book David Foster Wallace read with attention), says he participated in the exorcism of a girl. A Protestant minister and a Catholic exorcist were present. And you know, Peck was an intelligent, well-read man. And yet he believed in exorcisms.\n\nThe skepticism towards exorcisms that many people have is silly. To say that the devil is real is like saying that the Soviets have infiltrated American institutions en masse in the last century. Both assertions are very much true, but they\u2019re not something you can say in polite society. And most people are not very bright, but they are very vain, and so they pretend to believe in the fashionable thing. I have never seen a single competent \u201crefutation\u201d of the \u201cclaims\u201d of deliverance ministers. What I do see are patterns in their accounts, very striking patterns, patterns unexplainable within a materialistic worldview, occurring again and again.\n\nI will give a sinister example. There\u2019s a possessed homeless guy who wanders the streets where I live. He carries with him a large plastic bag with some soda cans in it. Sometimes he goes into a fit and starts screaming things like \u201cDemooonnnnn\u201d, \u201cHellllll\u201d, in a horrible, chill-inducing demonic voice, while banging the bag on the ground, making a loud clanking sound. Very well: there is a video on Youtube of a possessed Mexican homeless woman doing exactly the same thing. Plastic bag, soda cans, banging the bag on the ground, reacting hysterically to the prayers of a guy (a sure sign of possession, an exorcist will tell you). Very striking coincidence. Ah, but yes, sure: just a coincidence. It\u2019s not like the same kind of \u201cspirit\u201d is behind it. It would be credulous to infer such a thing, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nI could mention other examples. The more you examine the phenomenon, the more these \u201ccoincidences\u201d pop up. The very same, very idyosincratic behaviors, in Brazil, in Mexico, in America, in Europe. Even the DSM authors don\u2019t know what to make of it. They just call it \u201cPossession Syndrome\u201d now. There\u2019s an article about Friedkin\u2019s new documentary about exorcisms in Vanity Fair, I think. In it, a top US neurologist is shown a particularly striking video of a possession. His conclusion? \u201cYes, there is an alien intelligence behind her eyes\u201d. I paraphrase from memory. But yes: even licensed and credentialed and reputable men admit to the reality of demonic possessions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**And yet**\n\nAnd yet, I never saw Evelyn Waugh mention the subject. Or John Updike. Or Flanney O\u2019Connor. Or Thomas Merton. Or G.K. Chesterton. These are names with a radiant (and deserved) aura of respectability. Great Christian thinkers, great Christian artists. Chesterton himself said he never witnessed anything supernatural, although of course he believed in the supernatural. But the impression one gets is that all these people lived their whole lives placidly ignoring the subterranean reality of the demonic. And maybe that is a good thing to do. \n\nBecause once you get too deep into it, you succumb to puritanism. Listening to rock music and playing video games and watching anime: suddenly these might be \u201cdoorways to the demonic\u201d. Good-bye imagination. Good-bye life of adventurous cultural exploring, of glad immersion in music and movies and games. Indeed yesterday I was listening to Baths, a talented and respected electronic musician, and he draws inspiration from video games. I totally get what he means. The excess of playing the same JRPG for 12 hours straight, a feeling like traversing a desert, a sustained fugue state, the mental place it puts you in. Something hypnotic about it. Uh-oh \u2014 \u201chypnotic\u201d. Sounds like a doorway. \n\nHad my cousin and his band-mates been puritans, there would have been no band. I can picture a deliverance minister looking askance at a Dream Theater record. \u201cThrow that thing away\u201d, he might say. \u201cIt\u2019s opening demonic doorways into your life.\u201d Yes, once you go \u201cdeliverance ministry\u201d, puritanical perfection becomes the ideal. The temple of your life must now be emptied of everything remotely pagan and esoteric and sinister. Heavy metal? Castlevania? H.P. Lovecraft? Yeah, forget about it. \n\nSo maybe there is an ideal balance here. Maybe there is a good reason most pastors and priests don\u2019t talk too much about deliverace ministry. If you take Christianity away you get no culture. Christianity is the basis of civilization. We need the mental landscape of Christianity. It is because my neighborhood was a Mennonite neighborhood (that is, a Christian neighborhood) that its houses and gardens, its churches and churchyards, were pretty; that its people were civilized; that it had an air of order and beauty and decency.\n\nBut there may be such a thing as too much Christianity, or rather too radical a Christianity. My cousin and his band-mates were good men, intelligent, moral men, and their character, the character that is in their DNA, was forged by centuries of communal Christian living. And yet they didn\u2019t delve into the unpleasant subterranean matter of demonology. They were free from its clutches. They played Zelda and listened to Rush and did their homework and went to church. There is a degree of moral seriousness that is ideal, and that still allows for the unhindered development of imagination and creativity. Go beyond this ideal and you end up in a hysterical moralism, a place with the grim and barren air of an early Puritan Colony. (Early American Puritans frowned on poetry reading and novel reading. There is something inherently anti-imagination in the puritan spirit.)\n\nEverywhere in the world there are Christian communities with Christian youngsters eagerly developing their talents and cultural interests. And there are, too, the Bob Larsons of the world, the demon hunters, the professional demonologists. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I write all this because I\u2019ve been having certain personal troubles. I\u2019m showing symptoms of what a psychiatrist (that lovely class of professionals) would call schizophrenia. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a spiritual matter. I intend to see a Catholic exorcist next week. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to give up my cultural interests.\n\nLet me put it this way. Stephen Malkmus moved to Berlin on a psychic\u2019s advice. Noah Lennox lives in Lisbon and sees a psychic too. These are both deeply respected American musicians. And yet there is on Youtube a video of a Portuguese Catholic exorcist advising against seeing psychics. And the way he describes being possessed exactly matches the description I read in a deliverance ministry book written by an American Baptist pastor in the 1970s. \n\nGood Christian musicians are very rare. There is Sufjan Stevens. Who else? And even Sufjan makes a point of writing about astrology and things like that; it\u2019s almost like he feels a need to delve into paganism in order to shake off a squeaky-clean Christian puritanism, in order to lend a greater richness to his music.\n\nSo on one side you have Evelyn Waugh, W.H. Auden, Thomas Merton, Stephen Malkmus, you have the highbrows, the creatives, the bohemians. The ones who dabbled in drugs. The ones who were dandies in their youth. On the other side you have Malachi Martin, Bob Larson, Conrad Murrell, the deliverance ministers, the strict puritans, men the highbrows would despise, men they wouldn\u2019t be friends with. Men who seem, as a rule, to have a middlebrow, suburban, petit-bourgeois air to them.\n\nAgain: William Blake, \u201cThe Marriage of Heaven and Hell\u201d. Hell is the creative force. Nietzsche: Apollo and Dyonisus. Dyonisus is the creative force. (And isn\u2019t he the devil?) Auden\u2019s poem, \u201cThe New Decalogue\u201d, in which he enjoins \u201cthe sons of Hermes\u201d to not be serious, not be puritanical, but bohemian and creative. Again and again the same idea: that there\u2019s something hellish and reckless to creativity, and something dire and lifeless to puritanism.\n\nWhat if the flowering of good taste, natural and universal and irrepressible as it is, is incompatible with a radical Christianity? This is my last.fm profile: http://last.fm/user/milkmilch . Is this musical taste compatible with the kind of person who goes to see an exorcist?\n\nI don't know. I'm tired of living in this deliberate ambiguity. I'm tired of resisting. I'm tired of being depressed. Maybe I'll just become a \"radical Christian\". A guy other people might judge as \"hysterically devout\". I have the distinct feeling that this would be the path of peace, security, joy. But sometimes I wonder if I should really \"succumb\" to it. I don't know."}, {"author": "softrice666", "creation date": "2018-05-04 23:39:52", "selftext": "Hello, so I\u2019m going to try to make this as condensed as possible but it\u2019s going to be still quite length. Second, I\u2019m not expecting some diagnosis of any sort but more so some general opinion as to how who I can bring this up to (therapist or psychiatrist) and if schizophrenia is possibly developing for me?\nI\u2019m almost 17 so quite young but I\u2019m pretty\u2014 scared.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with disordered eating of some sort (restriction, overexercising, laxatives, etc.) since about the age of 9 along with occasionally purposeful self harm (bruising, light purposeful scraping of skin, etc) . Four years ago my dad remarried and we moved resulting in me falling down my mental health journey. I began to self harm more intensely now drawing blood, using blades, and bruising still. The school found out, I lied through my evaluation and stopped self harming for about four months before secretly beginning again, this time on my upper thighs. Since then it\u2019s been an on and off again thing.\nUnrelated but still I feel I should note: in the midst of having a panic attack after having gone over my calorie limit of the day my thoughts sped, images of obese women flashed in my head and I heard a voice telling me not to eat.\n\nFast forward, since about the 7th grade I\u2019d had sort of borderline delusional beliefs on being watched through cameras, etc but they happened so rarely I paid no mind to it.\n\n8th grade I attempted suicide and 9th my depression definitely was at its best but this was when I really began developing delusions thinking I wasn\u2019t in my body, that everything wasn\u2019t really happening but merely reality I was making up, and even thought my water in my home was being poisoned for a week. All I did was drink water outside of the house and if I recall correctly I even avoided eating at home. \n\nA 10th grade now, about two weeks ago I gradually began to \u201close it\u201d is as best as I could put it. It began with crying every night that week until about Friday when I began to feel everything was different. I began to think and feel as if the reality around me was merely an attempted simulation of my reality. That these were all people and relationships designed to look and feel like my real ones but weren\u2019t actually and that\u2019s why they felt so not real. During this time I was crying constantly, shaking, sweating, and didn\u2019t eat all weekend or ate a bit and would vomit out of anxiety not knowing what was happening to me or the world around me. At this point I hadn\u2019t showered in a week (or 2) and thought if I did it would ensure things wouldn\u2019t go back to how they were the last time I showered (feeling normal). I wouldn\u2019t drink from cups I hadn\u2019t drank from since my reality had changed, wouldn\u2019t listen to certain music, under the same impression I couldn\u2019t listen to them or else things wouldn\u2019t go back to normal. Sunday, I lost it. I began screaming and crying. Locked myself in the bathroom, self harmed on my arm, my thigh, and even busted my lip and bruised my cheek. I sort of thought that would make things feel back to normal. I was sobbing outside barefoot when my sister came home and I told her how scared I felt and just wanted things to feel normal. I was taken to the hospital and essentially released simply because I only had passive suicidal ideation and self harm. Since then I\u2019ve felt more optimistic (oddly enough) in myself and my future because I\u2019d made it out of that but I\u2019ve also slowly felt my mind convincing myself yet again that none of how reality currently is, is how it should be. That the truck is still on the wrong lane and somewhere the correct normal reality is still happening and I\u2019m in this alternate one. That this is all created in my mind.\n\n(For context; my mother has two brothers lost to suicide. She\u2019s diagnosed bipolar but the severity and nature of her paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions lead us [therapist, sister, and I] to believe she\u2019s been misdiagnosed. My therapist thinks she sounds schizoaffective while I\u2019m not sure other than on the schizospectrum but schizoaffective sure does fit)\n\nI showered two days ago but didn\u2019t shampoo or wash my body thinking I shouldn\u2019t shower until things go back to normal. I\u2019m teetering on three weeks without an actual shower. Since my hospital visit I\u2019ve been increasingly isolated, aggressive. My hygiene has been even shittier than usual (obviously). Increasingly emotionally stunted, disconnected. I almost just lose myself, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve really been mentally the last few days especially. I\u2019m scared of what\u2019s happening."}, {"author": "UnableGoose", "creation date": "2018-05-05 03:53:14", "selftext": "Hello!!\nI'm not to sure what I want to get out of this but I think I just want a tad bit of support and maybe see if anyone else can relate to anything like this and what their take on my situation is.\n\nSo about three months ago I had a panic attack, afterwards I experienced heavy dp/dr and because of this I genuinely thought I was going insane. After searching up symptoms and researching for days I've developed this fear of losing my mind, specifically developing some sort of mental illness like Schizophrenia. Generally the fears are either hallucinating or thinking in a delusional manner and when they are at full force it is pretty difficult to put them to rest.\n\nTo add to the stressors my father was diagnosed with Bipolar not to long ago, and I had smoked weed (three times to be exact) and my mind cannot put these factors to rest when the fear comes up into my mind. I've always had the fear of being like my father to a certain extent, however it did not affect me anything the way it is  right now. I keep thinking that I've messed with the chemicals in my brain by doing marijuana and triggered the onset of a severe mental illness.\n\nI've been to a psychologist who reassured me that I wasn't going Schizophrenic, however amidst all the DP/DR she didn't diagnose me with an anxiety disorder and questioned whether I should even bother coming for another appointment, as she was convinced the reason for the anxiety and worry was due to stress within my life, namely being financial issues/ moving away from home/ breakup etc. The reason behind this was due to the fact that without any treatment I do feel myself slowly getting better and overcoming the anxiety however it has been a fairly bumpy road.\n\nSo sorry for the long post and this is my first post on here so if I have done something wrong I am so sorry!!

It recommended *against* antipsychotics, and *for* benzodiazepines and NMDA antagonists. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nInterestingly enough, alcohol both increases GABA and suppresses glutumate (NMDA antagonist). However, it has a bunch of other weird crap going on, it doesn't come in a pill, and I highly doubt any psychologist would prescribe it. \n\n***\n\nMedications like benzos are used to treat things like insomnia, anxiety, and panic. Of course, this [naturally includes psychotic episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Other_indications). I've heard all about the insomnia that schizophrenia can bring about, and - of course - how prominent of a \"feature\" fear is in the disorder. Benzos are dangerous and mostly for short-term use, so I wouldn't actually recommend looking into this specific medication. Unfortunately, I don't actually know if there are any \"safe\" and \"therapeutically viable\" GABA medications.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMedications like [memantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memantine) (an NMDA antagonist, for reducing glutamate) are used to treat Alzheimer's disease, which, like schizophrenia, is riddled with symptoms like poor memory and organization, clumsiness, and especially *apathy*. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Here's a chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_schizophrenia#Add_on_agents) on the efficacy and side effects of various medications studied for treatment for schizophrenia. Memantine was \"well-tolerated\" and showed \"statistically significant improvement in negative and total symptomtology.\"\n\n***\n\nAgain, take all this with a grain of salt, and discuss this with a psychiatrist.

I'm currently on an antipsychotic (risperdal) only. He mentioned that my psychiatrist may need to check whether I need a mood stabilizer on my next visit but he gave the all-clear initially. I can only remember one longer episode of what could have been hypomania that was two years ago(before I started psychotherapy) and one instance where I was more outgoing and less introverted one evening but then went right into psychosis.\n\nThe reason we talked about it was because since I had increased my risperdal four weeks ago I suddenly became overly productive after the paranoia has passed and I'm have much more focus and mental clarity. He said if it was hypomania it would't last longer than a few days before my mental state starts to get worse, which did not happen.\n\nI'm now worried because I now got less stuff done this week. But I think I overthink that and I just got scared because my therapist threatened me with more pills...\n\nI'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder but I never was prescribed an antidepressant or mood stabilizer. I've heard that risperdal has mood stabilizing properties so maybe they cover my affective part enough. I've had depressive episodes but they came often after psychosis and since I got better at preventing psychosis they're less of a problem. My therapist is not sure about the affective part of my disorder yet. I guess it's just a \"too high functioning and a more episodic course so no schizophrenia diagnosis\" thing.\n\nSo any insights from you would be appreciated.

Usually people have their primary friends and friends who they talked to when none of their friends were around. I was always that person. I've met people who when their regular friends walk into the room forget and treat me different than anyone else. In my HS band class I purposely say stupid remarks because I know that If I stopped being a part of their foolishness I would slowly disappear and nobody would recognize me. I look at my so called \"friends\" stories and see them all together. I never get Invited to anything. Birthday parties or just regular hangouts. I guess nobody really liked me in the long term and my parents are very strict and won't let me hangout with my friends or even go to the mall. They say its for my \"safety\" and yet I've had more and more problems mentally because I am so alone. And it's not like I can just talk about this to anyone. Over the years I learned not to trust anyone. My parents, friends and even the counselors at my school. I think it's because when I was younger I used to cry a lot, but I was made fun of for it so I learned how to suppress and burry my feelings. And even if it was someone that I would trust I still wouldn't say anything. I don't know why I have such a problem talking about my feelings. I really didn't know I was doing that until one of my speech coaches told me I wasn't good at expressing the hurt or sad emotion. At face value I'm a pretty charismatic person and sometimes people call me funny. I don't have social anxiety or anything it's just nobody besides my parents honestly gives a shit about me. I just hope that the next mental breakdown that I have won't be explosive. One of the side affects of sealing your feelings is once in a while the seal breaks and you cannot control. With all these AP test coming up a break down is inevitable. To be honest I really hope that I don't have a mental illness. My mom has schizophrenia and I've heard that is hereditary and I might have a chance of getting it when I'm older. Schizophrenia has caused a lot of problems in my parents marriage ever since my mom started having it when they came to the US from Nigeria.

I\u2019ve been close to death a few times, but in 2016 when I had just turned 20 was the closest I ever got. I took 3 handfuls of mixed pills then chickened out a while later and went crying to my mom, we went to the hospital and they pumped me then sent me to the mental hospital. They were only supposed to keep me for the 3 days, but because I\u2019m introverted and didn\u2019t talk much they saw that as me \u2018isolating\u2019 myself and kept me for a week. I haven\u2019t tried since then because I don\u2019t ever want to go back there, so the next time has to be for sure. The reason I want to try again is because I graduated college yesterday and I don\u2019t think my life is going anywhere. I don\u2019t want to be like those people on the forums that are 47 and have been trying to kill themselves their whole lives.. I\u2019d rater do it while I\u2019m young than suffer another 30 years and finally realize life isn\u2019t for me.\n\nI called my mom today and she got mad at me for not being happy for just this one day and that I\u2019ll never be happy. I know this, but hearing her say it puts me in an even worse place. I used to be very private about anything I felt, not wanting to be a burden, but after my serious attempt my mom told me to talk to her. It didn\u2019t work out. Any time I tell her I want to kill myself she yells and says I say that to punish her and I\u2019m manipulating her. One of the worst things is she always starts crying and asking me what\u2019s so bad about my life and saying she tried so hard to give me a good life but she\u2019s a failure as a parent. I can\u2019t help that I\u2019m mentally ill and she doesn\u2019t understand how I think or feel\u2026 her saying those things only makes me feel worse. As a single parent and only child our relationship has always been rocky. She doesn\u2019t recognize the mental and emotional abuse she put me through as a child. Even though she did some terrible things I still love my mom. I feel like a burden and a disappointment. I graduated top of my class. I struggled so hard to keep a full ride scholarship, forced myself out of bed on the days I had given up to go to class anyways, hoping that this hard work would give me fulfillment, but I\u2019m still not happy. If I\u2019m not happy with that then I never will be. I had always planned if I didn\u2019t have a good job lined up or wasn\u2019t going to graduate school after graduation then I would kill myself. Now I\u2019m here and I don\u2019t know what to do. In 2016 it was so much easier because I had fought with both of my best friends and hadn\u2019t talked to them in months and I had a fight with my mom and didn\u2019t speak to her in months either. No one cared then and no one would get hurt when I killed myself. I tried to cut everyone off this time but they won't leave me alone and everyone is worried because of last time. I don\u2019t want to worry anyone, but I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m lazy and a failure and a hypocrite my mom always says \u201cHow can you be a psychologist when you can\u2019t even take care of yourself? You can\u2019t help others.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s true, but the only self worth or redeem I find is in trying to help others so they don\u2019t end up like me. \n\nI feel like I can\u2019t reach out to anyone. Any time I do they only turn it into how they feel, how I hurt them, and how I need help. I\u2019ve tried help. I\u2019ve been in therapy and on medication since I was 14, now I\u2019m 22 and just as miserable. I want nothing more than to be happy and content with life, but my whole family is cursed. My grandmother worked grueling days in a factory and had an abusive husband who tried to kill her. She was a terrible mother to my mom who got nothing but the shaft in life and had a husband who left her with nothing. She had to struggle to try and give me everything only to be left miserable with a job she hates, no money, and a horrible daughter who hates her life and just want to die. Nobody in my family has made a better life so how am I ever going to do it? I want such simple things. I want to go to graduate school to get a job I like, I want to be happy, I want to make enough money so I don\u2019t have to worry, I want to have health insurance so my family can go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick, all of that seems so impossible. I say I could be happy eventually, but I have a horrible combo of mental illnesses and I\u2019m diagnosed with something worse every year. Started off with anxiety, then depression, then adhd, then bipolar, then schizotypal.. soon it\u2019ll be schizophrenia since that runs in my family and manifests in early adulthood. Who can live with this constant mental attack? Life and my own brain are against me. The only thing I\u2019ve ever had is my intelligence but I can\u2019t even apply it because I let my illnesses hold me back and run my life. Everyone has a job lined up or is going straight to graduate school and I have nothing but a degree in an area that has no jobs. If I didn\u2019t have to worry about my mom, grandma, and pets things would be better. I could either kill myself or move across the country and do whatever I want, but I have to help support them. My mom tells me to worry about myself and she doesn\u2019t need me to support her, but then says she has no money and worries about where she\u2019ll be in a few months and is going to have to work until she dies. I feel so empty, like I don\u2019t live in my own body. I\u2019m only a robot here to support my family until they\u2019re comfortable and then I can finally die. Sometimes I wish I had siblings, so they could help the family and be my replacement. I don\u2019t have control of my life and suicide is the only comfort I have. Sometimes I get the tiniest moment of happiness or spark of hope that is immediately squashed by something terrible happening to me or my family. I want to end our family curse with me, and I can do that if I die. I don\u2019t know what to do, I want to die but I\u2019m so afraid of the burden I\u2019ll put on everyone around me.

I saw a doctor 3 months in and after a 30 second feel he told me to wear tighter underwear and take tylenol when it hurts. Since then the pain has gone from a dull ache, to sometimes a stabbing pain the spreads to my legs and lower back. I would like to see a new doctor but was unsure if i should see a special kind of doctor?\nMale, Age: 22 Race: White\nLocation: Missouri, United States.\nHeight: about 5'7\" Weight: about 250lbs\nMedications: I was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia about 2 years ago and take lots of prescribed medication for it. MORNING: (4.5mg Vraylar) NIGHT: (600mg Lithium Carbonate) + (200mg Lamotragine). Because of the amounts I NEVER put any other medications into my body. Not even OTC painkillers. All 3 medications are currently prescribed by my psychiatrist, separate from the earlier mentioned doctor. I do not smoke cigarettes.\nDETAILS:\nSo about 6 months ago I started to notice a dull ache in my balls. For awhile i ignored it but over 2 or 3 months it got to the point where i was regularly uncomfortable. I saw a doctor and after a quick feel, he told me that since i was not discharging anything it was likely because i often wear baggy underwear and pants. I left unsatisfied with the diagnosis but not really wanting to pursue this rather embarrassing issue any further, i decided he was right and i just needed to hope it would go away.\nNow its been almost 4 months since that appointment and things have gotten worse. These are the symptoms I am currently experiencing:\n-Changing levels of pain in one or both testicles. This pain often radiates to my legs, stomach, or lower back.\n-Darkened veins around my left testicle.\n-Sometimes i can feel a lump on my left testicle but other times it seems to disappear or i cant find it.\n-General tiredness. I just feel lethargic all the time. I realize for someone at my weight this may seem normal but its been worse recently.\n-Loss of appetite. I have to force myself to eat the maybe 1.5 meals a day ive been eating the past few weeks.\nIm not a doctor. Not even close, so im not going to try and diagnose myself. But from the light research ive done, im starting to think i may have testicular cancer. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer last year but made a full recovery (they got to it early) and i know cancer risk can be genetic so the more i look up symptoms the more sure i am. wich brings me to my main question:\n\nWHAT KIND OF DOCTOR SHOULD I SEE?\n\nAre there doctors that specialize in testicular cancer? or testicles in general? should I go to a cancer specialist or would that be assuming too much? Are there tests that can be done to determine if i have cancer, and what would they be?\nAny help is much appreciated. Right now i plan to look up and call whatever kind of doctor is recommended here tomorrow and schedule an appointment for Wednesday.

For the past 5 years I've been imagining a mechanical system that basically breaks down complex shapes into a simple origami style block. Think Isaac Clark's helmet from Dead Space, or Tony Stark's transforming helmet. Its... hard to design organic geometry to say the least. I had an epiphany today! And the inspiration came from some shoes my aunt gave to me. These are special laceless shoes that have a single wire laced over the tongue, which is tightened by a small disc at the top of the foot. This disc clicks in one direction, and simply loosens when you turn it the opposite direction. This mechanism is important because it solves a big manufacturing problem, every human head is shaped differently and every helmet design imaginable used today is designed not for the individual user but on a standardized size scale. Modern bicycle helmets use a similar concept to tighten, but the only part that tightens is a cheap plastic strap that wraps behind the base of the skull. I'm thinking a one size fits most standard, my prototype will be made of thick cloth loosely connected by elastic with a set of wires connecting all the cloth pieces so that when you turn the disc the wires straighten and the cloth securely wraps around the head to form a sealed helmet. Why a helmet? Because I'm gonna exploit the lack of mask-use laws in Texas and create a shortlived market of privacy helmets that are light and can be loosened into a pile of  interconnected patches that can fold into a backpack when not in use. I'll use the money to fund my real project, a faceless futuristic helmet that uses the same disc tightening system but with motors now, kinda like nike's self lacing shoes but in helmet form. Upgrades will come in the form of materials used, and since clear aluminum is a thing realistically I can now propose a budget plan for private funding to make electronic face concealing tech that darkens when it has electricity run through it. This basically translates to bullet proof helmet visors that become tinted to protect against sunlight or to just add a cool Tron helmet effect and conceal your face with a button. Considering no one has tackled turning helmets into fashion and personal privacy accessories I think I'm on the right track. I share this with my fellow people of r/schizophrenia because we lack privacy in our daily lives, we get prodded with needles all the time, people are always monitoring us in our daily lives. Forget having an attention grabbing t-shirt that hints at our illness, I want to be stylishly masked in public so people can't \"see\" me while not looking like a clunky 1950's bucket head iron man.

I don't know if this is the correct place to seek help, so if it's not, @mods delete the post.\n\nLet me start by mentioning certain facts. No one, except my grandmother (who is 76 and has been suffering from dementia and Parkinson's for around 8 years) has had any semblance of a mental illness. I have no experience with spending time around a person with a mental illness except my grandmother who is weak and not a threat (to herself or others). I'm already used to living with her and helping her out (as my parents work 12+ hours each day). However, there's a much bigger issue on the horizon.\n\nMy brother, who I'm very close to, has always been an intelligent, and nice person. I've had countless conversations with him about basic topics and much deeper ones (aliens, why we're here, the universe, the soul, etc.) and there were never any issues.\n\nHe has been taking drugs on the regular for the past 6 months (with the major damaging factor that I think has been the cause of what I am about to write being ecstasy - he probably took around 20-30 tablets in a 3-4 month period). For the previous 2 months (including this one), he's been growing more and more certain about stuff that just isn't right.\n\nHe thinks he is the new Jesus and that our hometown will become the center of the world (300k population in a small, second-world country of all places..). He tried his hardest to create a tornado to show his powers to me and my friends and when nothing happened, he said that it takes time to form (as if). \nHe also thinks that as long as you believe hardly enough in something, it will surely happen (such as saying that our country will win the soccer World Cup). A couple of days ago, there was a big storm in our town and he said he's the one who caused it because he was angry at something.\n\nAdditionally, during a music festival, a guy that overdosed on drugs died. This guy happened to grab my brother and my friend by their heads whilst he was falling backwards to the ground and going into shock. The frightening part of this is that my brother thinks he took the guy's life energy out of him and he's the reason he died.\n\nI know there is something very, very wrong with him and my thoughts are on psychotic episodes and maybe even schizophrenia (these are just my assumptions due to the evidence I've seen).\n\nI have no idea how to help him. My friends and I want to talk to him in a gentle way and try to help him understand what's happening, but I don't know if that will help or make things worse. I know he needs to see a mental health specialist and probably take anti-psychotics (if my hunch is correct) but I have a feeling he won't be inclined towards this. \n\nI'm becoming rather desperate because I am at a loss of what to do. He also thinks that me and my friends are the 12 apostles. I can't ignore him and shun him out of my life, and his parents aren't the best people around (who could have potentially even caused his drug issues and mental health problems due to being complete asses that never gave him any proper love, motivation, attention, or anything really and have always shot him down whenever he found something he likes, ie. recently he found a job and my uncle immediately told him to give it up because he knows a guy that failed in that line of work).\n\nCan anyone help me understand the path to approach this problem? I have millions of scenarios in my head about this situation but I'm still unsure of what the best course of action is. Do we present him with an ultimatum (which I think is a bad idea since he'll definitely stick with the drugs instead of us - and I'm not judging or feeling ignored because of this fact - it's drugs; they're bad if one isn't as careful as can be, and even then it's shady), do we talk to him in a normal way, do we try to show him evidence that what he thinks he's capable of isn't working (which, again, I think won't work because psychotic people can't see that they're in the wrong and ignore all evidence of the contrary).\n\nI'd really love to save my brother before it's too late..\n\nSorry for the long post. I appreciate each and every comment and little bit of help that I can get since this is the crucial moment to do something about it.\n\nThank you.\n\nPS - If anyone wants to know where I'm from, PM me.

In so far as how much it can influence me it seems that in someways it can control me. Can it make me shoot up a school? I think so but it won't.

They were convincing me that their reality of me having a bizarre life is real. At first I was really beginning to believe it because the false memories were just like actual memories. Eventually I made an ultimatum, and of course, the whole story was untrue.\n\nI then did some research on mental illness, coming to the conclusion that I have either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. \\(Along with thought disorders.\\) Soon after, I would try my best make them not talk to me which slowly causes mental exhaustion.

It would slowly get worse as the day went on, and randomly having episodes of them getting extremely nasty to me, and then suddenly becoming extremely down the dumps. I myself did not have these episodes. They knew every single thought I had and it came out as one of them. It was so annoying to have them know every single thought. Talking to people however, would make them keep quiet and speaking softly to myself.\n\nNext we now reach the night of 7th of May, where they start gaining power all of a sudden out of nowhere!

I had suicidal thoughts during the moments I lost control, the voices would even tell me to do it. I never did it, I stayed strong on those parts, but I knew that visual hallucinations would have possibly have done it. I knew it because way back in the past I've had sleep paralysis. Having an unknown fake object/person/entity in your presence puts unimaginable fear in your heart.\n\n8th of May, early up at 1:40 AM.

I was able to sleep like a baby.\n\nNext part is me waking up\\(just 3\\-4 hours ago\\) with the voices being very weak.\\(thank GOD!\\) It was so peaceful, I then thought that masturbation in moderation and slowly diminishing it down was the right thing to do. I then went to go take a shower, and since a lot of thinking is done in the shower they begun getting a TINY bit more active, I did not want to relapse even the slightest! I got out, quickly masturbated again. The voices went down once more. I've also been constantly telling myself the 3 phrases, and listening to music and singing along to the music.\n\nI would really love some help on where to go from here! I would love to just get rid of these voices completely, I don't know what to do and I definitely do not want to relapse. I don't know If my body is now used to 2\\-3 times a day, and I'm now stuck to must masturbate.\\( I REALLY HOPE NOT :\\(   \\)I'm not sure if I should continue with my plan of reducing it slowly, I don't know how slowly even. \\(days, weeks, months, possibly years..\\) I have masturbated once today, if I have to do it again, it would mean that I have went back to 2 time a day or maybe even 3..\n\nMy goal right now is to get rid of the mental illness and to get rid of my masturbation COMPLETELY. \\(i.e nofap4lyfe\\)\n\nThank you so much if you have read this entire post, I cannot thank you enough! I would really appreciate some feedback to help me out! Thank you once again.

She's actually my cousin's stepdaughter, but my cousin married her mother when she was pretty young and my mom and my cousin's wife are close. Too close because my mother is a total narc and not so great with reality either. \n\nI've started following B's YouTube videos. She's dating a minor celebrity, and is essentially a kept woman, so no worries about her being homeless right now, but I'm fairly certain she has schizophrenia or some similar disease. She thinks she has DID but her alters are more voices in her head. Also she talks to aliens who have told her she is special and they took her back in time... just many crazy stories that she honestly believes to be true. \n\nI've talked to my Nmom about it, suggested a book \"I'm not sick I don't need help\" (a great book btw for helping family members who don't think they need therapy) and she said that she thinks it's something \"darker\". My cousin's wife and I are getting closer but she thinks B is possessed too - and I'm sure my mom isn't helping and is getting into her head and perpetuating this belief. \n\nI just feel terrible because I remember B when she was young and she was so sweet. I hate to see her suffering and I'm concerned what will happen to her if her disease goes unchecked- she's admitted to suicidal and abusive behaviour towards others in her YouTube videos.

He is also a minor celebrity so he may think I'm just a bonkers fan. She has other family - an aunt who took her in for a while and a father - I'm not sure if they can help. It just bothers me because it seems like no-one knows what's wrong or is taking action and I know what's wrong (or at least the realm of it) and ways they could take action. \n\nI guess the best thing I can so is sit back and try to muzzle in my own mother's crazy and talk her mother  down from the demon possession theories.\n\nThere is always the option of stepping up and contacting her directly but I'm not sure how that would go.

I just really wanted to get the circumstances of my diagnosis off my chest. It's been really bugging me for a while and I want to know anybody else can relate to what happened.\n\nIt was my third inpatient hospitalization. I was only 16, meaning that my disorder was somewhat early onset, but my own doctor had been considering the possibility of schizophrenia (to dismiss an earlier diagnosis of psychotic depression) due to my unresponsiveness to treatment for depression along with a clear lack of many depressive symptoms and the intensity and content of my psychotic episodes. I had been admitted due to an apparent suicide attempt which I almost did not survive. At the time of admission, I was completely unaware of this attempt and could not explain the large wound I suffered. To this day I am sure I had hurt myself so seriously during a psychotic break, of which I have no recollection.\n\nUpon admission, the doctors immediately dismissed any explanation my parents or myself had given regarding my psychotic symptoms. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and all accompanying psychotic symptoms written off as \"attention seeking behavior\" due to my age and the apparent \"suicide attempt\".\n\nHere's where it starts bugging me. Having been given this diagnosis, I was taken off all antipsychotics and sleeping pills I had been taking to manage these symptoms, as they were deemed \"ineffective\" and \"unnecessary\", despite the fact that they had been shown to ease my symptoms drastically (albeit with some serious side effects). Even my parents had given them this information, which they ignored. I was placed on Prozac only.\n\nThis is where my memory fails me and I must repeat what I am told. On the third or fourth day of hospitalization, nurses on staff noticed I had not left my room for meals or group therapy sessions. According to patients and staff present at the time, I had stopped talking completely and acknowledge but could not seem to physically respond to simple commands. I started taking part in bizarre, ritualistic behaviors, and became extremely fearful of nurses and staff. I had gone in to take a shower, and at some point had ripped all the stitches out of my arm with force, losing a substantial amount of blood and creating an even more difficult wound to close. According to other patients, the nurses were yelling at me and causing me to become more fearful and withdrawn, telling me to \"snap out of it\" and that these attention seeking behaviors would not work. When I did not improve, they deliberately ignored me and advised other patients to avoid giving me attention or trying to help.\n\nThey had allowed this episode to go on for six hours until nurses noticed not only a bleeding arm but other self destructive behaviors like tearing my own hair out, which caused them to call a code. They injected me with Haldol and left me to sleep it off for several hours before taking me to the hospital to close the wound up. I remember waking up still clutching two very large clumps of hair.\n\nIt was only at this point that they began to listen to my parents' account of what I was suffering, and began to listen to my story as well. I was discharged a few days later with a new prescription for Geodon (which has been very effective) and two sedatives for insomnia. I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, and the staff apologized profusely because they were \"frustrated\" and did not understand what was wrong leading up to the psychotic break, despite my own warnings that I did show psychotic symptoms and I don't feel it's safe to go off antipsychotics.\n\nGuys I am extremely upset by what had happened. I feel like I suffered a great injustice at their hands and that they deliberately ignored me when I desperately needed treatment. While I went on to be treated for schizophrenia with really great success (not cured, but functional!), I don't think this should have happened.\n\nHas anybody else been mistreated at hospitals?

If you've read my previous post about \"auditory hallucinations\" you would know that I get these random intrusive phrases either in my voice,  my family or friends voice saying random phrases that constantly pop into my head.

They usually happen when I'm alone or not going anything intense, but I was on the internet and I found that these are called \"mind pops\" but mine aren't about memories. I found that they are common in people with anxiety and OCD, but I've found they are even more common in people with schizophrenia. And there were 3 articles that showed experiments done by professors that proved they are common in people with schizophrenia, and develop into auditory hallucinations later on. I had a huge anxiety attack because I've been worrying I might have schizophrenia for the past 5 months and I experience mind pops ALL the time. Everybody else said they experience them about 4 times a week, but I experience at least 31 each day, and they get worse and I get more of them when I worry and obsess over them.

She doesn't believe any of this now but when I met her she thought magic might be real and that her mother and grandmother saw ghosts. Luckily she listened to reason but she used to believe some strange things. When she told me about how her mother and grandmother saw ghosts I asked her if there was Schizophrenia in her family on her mother's side. Yep. So I asked her if she thought that was a coincidence and how I managed to guess it. Seems like a pretty lucky guess, right? So either I have a horsheshoe up my ass or I guessed that for a very good reason. Well she eventually saw the truth. Her mother was never diagnosed but she is clearly mentally ill. Like clearly. If you met this woman you would immediately see it too. So she was pretty open to the idea that she might just have some problems and the ghosts might not be real.\n\nWhat took a little longer, though, was to get her to accept that magic wasn't real. She said she saw some weird things so she believed it could be real because she didn't know what to make of them. So I decided to use a similar approach I used with the ghosts. I'm from Vegas so I've seen plenty of stage magicians. I've seen Copperfield and Burton at least a dozen times each. We used to take people from out of town all the time because that's kind of what you did in Vegas at the time. Not so much anymore though. So I asked her if she thought they were doing real magic or if they were tricks. She said she didn't know so I said if they were doing real magic they would be wizards. So did she believe Penn and Teller, David Copperfield, etc. were sorcerers? No, she didn't. She eventually admitted she knew they were doing tricks. Okay. So then magic might not be real, right? In fact, it probably isn't because nobody's been able to do it and prove it, right? Someone should have come up with some good hard evidence by now, right?\n\nAnd that's when she told me the story. Apparently her grandmother owned a real estate company with someone else in the 70s. It was a small company but my friend's grandmother's partner was pretty wealthy. Like suspiciously wealthy, apparently. I don't know many details because she didn't want to give me specifics but from what I know he did legally dubious things and had predatory business practices. Sort of like a small town Donald Trump. Kind of like that. So this guy had his lawyer draw up all the contracts and my friend's grandmother signed them without really knowing what was in them. I never said she was a good businesswoman. Well, one day she finds out he has the option to buy her out whenever he wants to as long as he offers 125% of what her stock was worth. At least that's the way my friend heard it. So he did and then he sold the company after making a large deal. So he made a ton of money off this small company and my friend's grandmother made a lot less than she would have. Like a LOT less.\n\nAnd then he died a couple months later. So I asked her what this had to do with anything. I mean it's kind of an interesting story but what did this have to do with magic? She said \"She got mad at him.\" Wait, what? What does that mean? \"You just don't understand.\" Okay, then explain it to me. \"She got mad at him and he died.\" Okay, now I was frustrated. I don't like conversations like that. If you don't want to tell me, say you don't want to tell me. Don't make me dance around like an asshole. So I told her she needed to tell me the story or just say she won't tell me. But make the decision now because she's being very rude. So she said \"Okay. She got mad at him and she was a witch. When a witch is mad at you they can do things. Do you get what I'm saying?\"\n\nYep. I got what she was saying, alright. Her grandmother killed her business partner. I straight up asked \"Are you telling me she killed him?\" She said \"Weeeelllllll.....\" Oh no. Okay, so clearly her grandmother was not a witch and she did not put a curse on this man. But I think she did kill him. I think she really did poison this guy or something. I tried to get details. Like how did she put the whammy on this guy? What sort of hex was it? She wouldn't say. I asked her if she knew anything about it. She said \"I know a little.\" The rest was like pulling teeth but eventually I got her to admit her grandmother went to her partner's house to yell at him and try to get some money and that was the last time she saw him. He died about a week later. So that seems weird, right? About a week. Like why didn't he die that day? So I think she might have slowly poisoned him or maybe just waited a few days to avoid suspicion.\n\nEither way though, my friend and her mom both always accepted the idea that grandma killed this guy so that tells me this was a woman who, when you met her, you could believe she'd kill someone. And that seems even more suspicious to me. I've never met her personally but I seriously think she really did kill this guy. I wish I could find out more about this but I've searched for a real estate developer dying under mysterious circumstances in Florida sometime in the mid-70s and no luck. I don't know my friend's grandmother's name either so that doesn't help. I know her first name but not last. She was married a couple of times and she just kept her second husband's last name according to my friend but she won't tell me what it is. It probably wouldn't even be the same anyway. I doubt she was on husband number two by this time. I think she knows I'm curious enough to try to find out what really happened and she's afraid her grandmother might be charged. There's no way. I mean it's a case from the 70s and there just wouldn't be any usable evidence at this point. Plus it's Florida. They have other things to worry about beside a senior citizen who may or may not have killed someone over 40 years ago.\n\nI still try to pry the details out of her every now and again but I don't think I'll ever get the real story. She'd have to ask her grandmother for one. She now sees that her grandmother is not a witch and that if something happened to this guy it was not her voodoo doll or whatever but she just doesn't want to get into it. I can't blame her too much, honestly. I don't think I'd want to hear my grandmother recount a murder she committed. That would be an uncomfortable Thanksgiving dinner, right?

He does return to rational thought/speech patterns, but becomes very emotional and unpredictable when at all escalated. \n\nHas anyone else experienced watching a friend develop Schizophrenia? What was it like for you? Do you have any advice for how I should handle this moving forward? I don't want to lose my best friend."}, {"author": "randomoutsider", "creation date": "2018-05-11 16:50:08", "selftext": "is it possible to have schizophrenia along with aspd or schizophrenia along with psychosis??

But I have been researching the topic for six years and over time it has become almost like a personal issue for me. If this post doesn't fit on this sub, by all means, take it down, but I felt like I needed to come to this community for something.\n\nLike I said, this illness has become almost a personal issue for me, and the lack of understanding most people have on mental illness, and the stigmas that surround this disorder, are frustrating and saddening. Recently I began a short webcomic, a prologue to a bigger story- the main character is a girl with schizophrenia and I decided to do a comic about her first experiencing symptoms as a child (she got very unlucky) and eventually being diagnosed. The full story takes place when she is older and a big part of my goal with the story is to portray someone with mental illness not only from an educated point of view (rather than a Hollywood one), but also give them a role as a strong protagonist. I believe people suffering from this illness deserve a lot of respect- you guys deal with things I can't even imagine having to deal with, and you deal with it every day.\n\nThe point is, as much research as I've done, I'm trying to make sure I write this illness as accurately as possible, and I was hoping maybe I could ask questions, because even though I feel very informed, I'm always worried I could have something wrong. If anyone would know about the experience of having schizophrenia, having visits with psychiatrists, and taking medication, it's those suffering from the illness. It would also be nice if you could direct me to reliable sources about this illness- there are so many misleading ones out there and I don't know what to trust besides the photocopies of schizophrenia's entry in the DSM, and from what I learned in my psychology class.\n\nOnce again, if this post doesn't fit, please go ahead and take it down. I figured this community would be the most authentic source of info, but I understand that this is a place for those dealing with this disorder to come talk to each other, and I don't want to interrupt that.

I have schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder, depression, anxiety, adhd, bipolarity, insomnia, and short term memory loss. I want to make the next game for my studio about schizophrenia. I think the main character should start out without schizophrenia and slowly have it build, so that the first few hallucinations you have you think are real, but then you slowly realize that they arent. I want there to be hallucinations as a sort of augmented reality AND completely encapsulated hallucinations in which nothing at all is real. The goal is to make the player question what is and isnt real in the same way we do. I want this game to teach people about our struggles. I want to make this plot interesting with many twists, but am not sure where to start. I think two other characters should have schizophrenia, the antagonist and the protagonists right hand person. Does anyone have ideas for a story structure? How should the schizophrenic characters interact with each other and other characters, as well as the rest of the world? Keep in mind i want this to be as accurate a depiction as possible, so certain things (like hallucinating a wall that keeps you from moving forward until you unlock something) would be out of the question. Where can I find resources to build this kind of plot? What character archetypes should be involved? I think it should be set in the future. How could futuristic technology affect this story? What would make a story like this appeal to you the most? What about this story could best show people without schizophrenia what its like? What gameplay mechanics would fit well in this context?

After middle school I attended a summer program, where I first met someone who actually understood me, and I felt I understood. \nTwo years later, she took her own life, recording her note and suicide on camera. I vividly remember the way her hand twitched as if beckoning me, as she tried to pull the trigger of her pistol another time. She shot herself twice in the head and died almost immediately. At the time of her death she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, her doctors also think she had DID but were unwilling to give a diagnosis because this condition is essentially a death sentence. She was on LSD, 25-I-NBOME, cannabis and cocaine at the time of her death.\nShe killed herself because she was also abused from a young age, bullied in and outside of school. After other suicide attempts her parents sent her to an asylum where she continued to experience assault and abuse. She took her own life when she was visiting home, knowing returning to the asylum would result in continued abuse.\nI managed to graduate high school and start college before I was assaulted again, some of my classmates tried to take my life, and I ended up in a similar asylum. I was assaulted there as well, and tried to kill myself in the asylum the day after the assault while on hospital grade morphine. \nI left the state several days after, found a full time job living with my parents, and have been working ever since. I continue to experience abuse and bullying but less so than before, but I still experience suicidal thoughts. My doctors think I have DID but aren't willing to give a diagnosis because they also consider it a death sentence. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nAt this point it is very surprising that I am still alive, and back in the asylum I told myself that I would wait six months and if I was still suffering I wouldn't proceed in this life. Most people with my conditions attempt suicide and many of us are successful.\nIf people close to me discover I am suicidal I will likely end up back in an asylum, or in prison for possession of an unregistered firearm (a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison in my state). Both of these options will only lead to more abuse and more suicidal thoughts. \nI feel like there is no way out of this situation if my personality dissociates to a suicidal one.

I\u2019ve always had neurological issues since I was a kid and was diagnosed with ADHD at age 5. What can I do? I\u2019m scared to go on antipsychotics because I know they can really mess you up but my last therapist recommended that. What are my options, how can I know what\u2019s going on? No one wants to even go near diagnosing me and when I brought up schizophrenia with my last therapist she brushed it off and said that everyone jumps to worst thing and that it was probably lack of sleep.

My father and my husband are both diagnosed various places (depending on practicioner) on the very high functioning end of the schizophrenia/schizoform/schizotype spectrum.  It does not matter which, because the positive negarive symptoms don't change regardless of how they label it.\n\nDad:\nPositive: believes he is descendend from \"German Fae\" and can control electricity with his mind.  He believes he can cure cancer by reading certain books backwards.  He believes he is a top level secret clearance government employee (he is occassionally a government contractor on specific projects).\nHe always believes the person who has the most influence in his life without question-regardless of their intentions. (Usually whatever his spouse says, occasionally a boss or parent in luckier times)\n\nHe is unable to reconcile or understand anything negative involving interpersonal interactions.  \n\nHe believes he is smarter than all doctors, and has only admitted in 5 minute intervals about 5 or 6 times he even has the diagnosis. (The first time he told me was when I hospitalized myself after a failed suicide attempt, my nurse would only let him in if he admitted to me he was also in the same hospital, when, and his diagnosis.  I was admitted for GAD/Major Depression.  He brought pizza, it was a decent moment on his part. He quickly got off the topic ASAP even then)\n\n  He is grandiose, very easily manipulated by people who prey on people like him and feed into his delusions.\n\nNegative: Difficulty concentrating, self isolation. \n\nI was abused horrendously by my father's first spouse, when he saw her try to hit me, he would pull her away, then she would scream \"all she has to do is call him crazy\" and he would shrink away, and fail to defend me further.  Most of my life, I thought *she* was the schizophrenic,  she ended up with multiple diagnosis and I learned from my hospital stay the schizophrenics werent like her at all.  (Bipolar people off meds are)  So, anyway... I was beaten up a lot by my mom, I am NC with her over a decade.\n\nDad got promptly remarried to a woman who feeds his delusions that he is \"smarter than doctors\" as she and her family feed into his delusions in exchange for bleeding him dry for money.  He lost one house and seems to be also losing his newest one.  My parents used to survive by kiting credit cards, my guess is he never stopped.\n\nHe is a very talented person who works in an art-type field, he is successful because my grandparents are successful and were successful enough that he got a niche as 'eccentric' before schizophenia became less demonized.\n\nOn account of my father's new family,  we are mutually low contact.  It hurts, but I refuse to feed his delusions and even when I point out specific instances of his step daughters selling drugs or porn out of his home, he simply gets angry with me for 'shaming their family' by pointing out drugs and porn are being trafficked via his home over the years.  It is fucking awful.\n\nNext story:\n\nHusband, usually medicated \nPositive Symptoms: Paranoia about 'Reptilians', sees \"Shadow People\" in mirrors, mostly mild visual hallucinations and paranoia types.\n\nHis negative symptoms are exactly the list on the sticky when off meds, all of them.\n\nI found out from our pharmacist my husband has not been picking up his medication for almost 10 months.  I feel stupid for not checking. His paranoia has increased, his suicidal idealation has increased, and he started seeing things again.\n\nLast night he hit me, for the first time in our entire relationship.  Remember how I said my dad's first wife used to beat the crap out of me?  I freaked out and called 911.  I fucking ran with the phone in my hand in a downpour waiting on the police.  My husband admitted to hitting me, the police knew he 'off' and offered to take him into custody and strongly advised I consider allowing them to.\n\nI just wanted to send the message: \"I do not tolerate being hit, ever, by anyone\".  It was mother's day.  I am in treatment and compliant to my treatments for the anxiety/depression/flashbacks I experience.\n\nI leveraged the calling the police into getting my husband to reestablish regular therapy appointments and med checks again.\n\nIn the meantime, I am unhappy.  I cant think of a better word.  After the police left my husband tried to make a huuuuuge show of taking knives to his wrists, which he has never done before.  We have been married over 5 years.\n\nHe never hit me before, he never attempted violence on himself before.  I am waiting for a call from my therapist.  I spoke to my local crisis line last night who said I am doing all the right things.  I have close friends who know the situation.\n\nI got him back on his meds and his symptoms stopped and he suddenly went back to \"normal\" and seems geuninely appalled and sorry about last night.\n\nI am still keyed up and feel overwhelmed\n\nI wish my husband would go to work so I could have the afternoon alone, but even though he slept a full night (I didn't) he wants to \"stay home and make up for everything\"\n\n\nLogically, I understand why if he expressed such profound symptoms why staying home is not a *bad* idea for him, but I want to have time alone.  I am trapped with my own anxiety and after he hit me last night I dont feel like I can fully breathe.  I was really looking forward to him going to work so I could process everything.  It's still raining, and there isn't anyplace in driving distance I can go today.\n\nSince he was suicidal yesterday,  I know I still need to watch him, which is why I thought I would vent here since he says he can't work today\n\nWhat now?"}, {"author": "schizodepressive2", "creation date": "2018-05-14 19:49:43", "selftext": "This is my first day on this board.

It has been very difficult to write coherently and want to be as detailed as possible. I should mention, I do have ADHD (diagnosed when I was a kid) and have dealt with anxiety and moderate insomnia before my condition started. The first stage of my condition began in February 2017 when I felt somewhat peculiar walking out of a concert and later woke up to multiple panic attacks within two days. The worst of them gave me pressure in my head and and my whole body was shaking. Soon after I became irritable, starting having gut issues, developed mood swings, needed to pace around, and became paranoid of my health. The mood swings were so apparent that I would get very teary eyed for no reason like suddenly watching a sad moment in a movie. During this time, I was tapering down off of venlafaxine (Effexor), for the last several weeks and thought this was definitely signs of withdrawal. After going back on it for a period of time I didn't feel the medication working.\n\nIn the second stage of my condition, I developed extremely bad insomnia despite using supplements such as Melatonin, magnesium, Zinc, or even CBD oil and resorted to alcohol. Even the days I got noticeable sleep I still felt this strong irritability which made it difficult to be productive. When I would relax I started to get muscle spasms in my left thigh and a non itchy rash on my left calf that reappeared every few months. In the third stage, I started to see floaters, lines in my peripheral vision, and for a split second would hear and see things that weren't really there (which I believe this to be very much like sleep deprivation not schizophrenia). I developed brain fog, issues with my short term and working memory. My muscle spasms I started to feel now in my arms and the back of my neck and my insomnia worsened. In the fourth and current stage, it is clearly apparent I have some kind of cognitive deficit that is either been some exacerbation of my ADHD or what I believe to have been brought on by some kind of neurological condition. My working memory is so bad I need to be instructed multiple times before I can do even simple tasks. I have lost interest in all my hobbies and can barely read, write (misspell words and question using the correct word/phrase), hard to concentrate in conversation, and constant scattered thoughts and periods of being brain dead. My coordination is a disgrace; frequently drop objects, feel like my legs are going to give out like I am the leaning tower of Pisa, and it seems like I am rocking back and forth when I sit and when I lay down. Lastly, I have these very strange headaches that I can only describe as burning and stinging sensations that come from the center of my head. I have had many(voluntary) ER trips, doctor visits, multiple blood tests, 3 CT scans, three MRI\"s (two in june 2017 and one in March 2018, an ENT, an Optometrist visit (two blood vessels popped and pressure back of eyes), an Endocrinologists, a few sessions with a psychologist , routine psychiatrist visits, and seen two neurologists. What has been found are a slightly elevated cortisol levels, a maxillary sinus cyst, one blood test with a low TSH, and vitamin D deficiency (which I have known about and have been treating it for years).\n\nIt has been about 16 months since my issues began and despite the testing, medication, and therapy my symptoms still persist. I am now as I have been really concerned that I may have a underlying issue and the medications are just masking a few of the symptoms. Let me reiterate, what I am experiencing has changed my perception of who I am and understanding the world around me. Despite my intuition, and because that nothing has been found, my primary care physician and my family believe all my symptoms are only mental and want me to continue seeing my psychiatrist to find the right medication. Unfortunately the three tests that would identify or eliminate something severe would be a spinal tap, genetic testing, and a PET/Spect scan. At this point I want some closure. Unless I start to seizure or show severe signs of a rare disease, I don't see myself getting these tests anytime soon.\n\nI have researched and researched a lot in the last several months to understand what could be my infliction. I have not found a single person on any forum who has the same set of symptoms as I do which has increased my fear for something rare. These are the possible diseases that match my presentation and progression of symptoms:\n\n* Gut infection (candida)/ Leaky gut/Sensitivity\n* Lyme Disease (without fever or Bulls eye rash)\n* Hard to detect thyroid issue\n* Bipolar/ Obsessive Compulsive Health anxiety (mimicking worse diseases)\n* Autoimmune disorder\n* Whipple's Disease\n* Multiple Sclerosis\n* Voltage Gated Potassium channel Antibody Encephalopahty\n* Prion disease\n* Sporadic Fatal Insomnia\n* Sporadic Creztefult Jacob Disease VV1\n\nWhat in gods name is wrong with me?\nWhat would be the appropriate next step?  \n\nEdit: Recently my symptoms especially my perceived cognitive issues are much more apparent and intense throughout my day.

If anything my mood has improved a bit because of the increase in lithium. Lamictal will take at least a month to work. ugh. I don't feel depressed but I still don't want my future. My psych told me today that I seemed to be getting better and I barely had the heart to tell them that I'm not fine at all.\n\nI just don't want this anymore. I deserve the choice. And I'm sorry I'm using my choice to hurt others.\n\nI think this might be my last post here. I'll try get my family to post on the weekend if I go through with it.

Trying different medications has been hell \\(I'll save you the gory details\\), but I've finally found a concoction that works for the most part.\n\nThe problem is that the meds have taken away so much of what made me me. I used to get enthusiastic about things like playing guitar, writing poetry, making fan\\-videos, playing video games, riding my bike, target shooting, etc. I don't care about anything anymore. I force myself to ride my bike for exercise not enjoyment and I can't even find entertainment in video games \\(I used to be a big gamer\\). I haven't taken my guns out in a long time either.

I live alone so at night I try to force myself to play some video games because they used to bring me joy, but I'll play a couple matches of Dragon Ball FighterZ or something then log off. I just can't stay interested.\n\nOn the other hand, the voices in my head are quieter and my mood is far more stable than it used to be. The meds are helping. I used to be extremely suicidal and it's been 4 years since my last attempt \\(that's very good for me\\).

He told her there's a long line of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (i have aunts uncles and a sister who are diagnosed schizophrenic). Then she proceeded to tell me she was never diagnosed bipolar and only sought treatment for severe depression (not for very long) and i mentioned i have researched mental illness and more specifically personality disorders in my last semester at college and she said \"oh, that too\" and i asked her which one while naming a few \"borderline, dependent, anti-social..\" and she said with conviction \"borderline\", but told me she didn't believe the therapist because before the diagnosis they had her husband answer a questionare and she thinks he lied on it so she could qualify for disability in our state and be able to stay at home. If i wasn't already aware that me and her both have bpd I'm sure I'd believe her about him lying in favor of the disability thing but honestly i don't think he lied about her being \"moody and unstable\" because she always was throughout my childhood with occurences like throwing his clothes out in garbage bags in the street and tipping christmas trees because he was late coming home, it makes more sense than ever. I'm trying not to resent her for not seeking treatment, she's never even been on SSRIs or any other medication for a long period of time, but I'm just imagining what i would be like without being raised by emotinally abusive parents, a bpd mother and an alcoholic step father. I don't hate them or blame them because they are better now in general and if anything it helps to be able to connect the dots of my youth but wow my life would be so much easier if she sought treatment and if he got sober before he physically abused me and my sisters. At least now i know that it's crucial for me and my siblings to seek treatment for this so we don't make the same mistakes. They don't know they have bpd and don't know what it is either and i know I'm not qualified to just say they have it but it's pretty clear as any of you who knew you had bpd before you were professionally diagnosed know too.

But I was told that those who smoke and don\u2019t have a good diet can half there life span. So, if you smoke and have a bad diet you might not make it to 40 yrs of age. If you include how much stress schizophrenia already puts on the body that can make things even harder. Now I\u2019ll eat healthy sometimes but it never lasts long. But, I\u2019m going to make an effort to not smoke after this weekend ... yes I want to quit. That\u2019s gonna be especially difficult because I usually smoke 25-30 a day. But the last two days I\u2019ve only smoked 10-15 so I\u2019m getting there slowly! I wanted to make an effort this morning with my health so I made some cooked zucchini and half an avocado mixed it in a bowl and put some salt on it and that was my breakfast.

Especially when being diagnosed with a tough mental disorder like Schizophrenia. I\u2019m not a doctor but I do know the amount of weight that antipsychotics put on, and how stressful the sight and sounds of schizophrenia is for every different person. It\u2019s important to have a good diet because that way your body is being taken care of. And so will your mind. Smoking isn\u2019t healthy and being more stressed and not doing the good that your all body needs can only lead to more bad things. \n\nLast time I tried to quit smoking I ended up self harming. I wish I kept going those few days without smokes even if it meant scarring my arms and legs. It\u2019s better then smoking and making your health get worse rather then better. Plus schizophrenia already lowers your immune system and can only mean that living won\u2019t be for as long if you don\u2019t make an effort to make it better and last for ages. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you have to perfect. But it\u2019s good a good place to start is to eat better and lower the amount you smoke if you smoke at all. \n\nThank you and sorry for such a long post!

I was looking up state laws on temporary holds and kinda broke down and realized I just absolutely had to say something to someone, so here I am.\n\nEarlier I tried to talk to my parents. Or rather, I was so incapable of concealing my issues that talking to them was unavoidable. It didn't work. I knew there was no point talking to my mother, I love her but she truly does not understand and any time I've tried to express my feelings to her it's like talking to a remarkably unsympathetic alien. My father at least understands some of it, but when I told them as carefully as possible that I was basically suicidal, he started in on the whole \"you're just making excuses for yourself\" spiel. I said fuck you and left the room, a few hours later he came and asked me about my schedule tomorrow like nothing had happened and that's it. I feel like a bit of a drama queen for this but I kind of can't believe they left it at that. I guess it's good they did in that a further conversation would be useless. But...you tell a parent you're thinking about offing yourself and they don't follow up on it, that kinda stings. Maybe they think I'm just being dramatic. Ever thought about killing yourself out of spite? I totally did, \"man if I just jumped off the roof right now they'd feel like real assholes.\" It's not my style, my suicide will be a purely selfish affair, but even the thought feels embarrassing. The ability of parents to make you feel like a child is aggravating beyond belief.\n\nI have a girlfriend. I guess. I told her a bit of how I was feeling last week. I mean, we've been together 3 years and I was up front from the beginning that I suffer from pretty severe depression and anxiety, but last week I tried to tell her just how dark it had gotten. I couldn't bring myself to tell her all of it. She made the right noises and expressed concern and all that but the last time I heard from her was a really terse response after I tried to make sure she was okay on Sunday \\(Mother's Day, her mother killed herself almost 2 years ago very suddenly after going off her schizophrenia meds\\) and it's 3 am Wednesday morning now. This isn't unusual, she works a really busy and irregular schedule and not hearing from her for 2\\-3 days isn't abnormal but it kind of hurts because I know she knows I've been thinking I'd be better off dead and I guess it feels like if I could see through my own shit long enough to make sure she was okay on Mother's Day maybe she could check in. I don't know why she's still with me, I don't know how it is that I'm such a loser and deadbeat and sad sack and she still cares, but I guess I'm glad she hasn't been in touch. Either I'd have to lie to her, or I'd have to tell her the truth and drag her down with me. As desperately as I want her right now, I think this is better. It might be tomorrow, it might be years away but it's very unlikely I'm going to die from natural causes and she doesn't deserve to have to go through that again. I should have broken up with her years ago. Actually, I did once, but everyone yelled at me and I got right back together with her and felt like a piece of shit for putting her through that. Still do, years later, and I guess I should because that was a shitty thing to do. I should have stuck to my guns, because when I think of who would be affected if I was gone, she's the only one I really worry about.\n\nTonight I cut myself. I've never done that before. Just a little cut on my arm, about an inch and a half long and not very deep. I had to try like hell to even break skin, all I have right now is a utility knife that clearly needs a new blade. I didn't want to kill myself. I still don't. I really don't want to die. I just want more than anything to stop feeling this way, and I'd read from people who cut themselves that it achieved that. Well, it fucking didn't. Now I'm depressed as fuck \\*and\\* I have a cut on my arm I have to hide from my family for a couple days.\n\nI had some whiskey, about a pint. I thought it might be enough to make me numb enough to sleep. It wasn't, now I'm still unable to sleep because my brain is going a mile a minute but I have a slight buzz. Plus, anything I do now will just make people think I have a drinking problem. I don't have a drinking problem, I drink 1\\-2 beers every week or two when I go out with a buddy or my gf. What I do have is a marijuana problem. I smoke daily to cope with insomnia \\(I'm aware that marijuana withdrawal can cause insomnia, as can marijuana dependence, but I had extremely severe insomnia my entire life until I started smoking\\) and lately to distract myself. Weed, reddit, and video games are what I turn to to get away from my own mind. Sometimes all 3 together. Probably not a great thing but weed does more for my depression and anxiety than the prescription meds I take.\n\nI guess I haven't talked about why I'm depressed. I mean, I'm depressed because there's not enough of whatever chemical in my brain. I can't tell you how infuriating that is to know. Since I was about 10 I've felt miserable, out of place, inadequate, and doomed, and knowing that those feelings, those years of pain and misery and sadness and fear and missing out on life, are all because I have 3&amp;#37; too little serawhosit...I really can't express the rage I feel at that. But I'm 26 now and I've gone ahead and given myself some real problems. I'm on I think year 7 of my undergrad and one more semester just turned into two more. I've been broke and unemployed for several years now. Walking down the street I feel ashamed of my clothing, of the amount of money in my pocket, of who I am. I worry that someone will recognize me, want to talk, and ask me \"so what have you been up to.\" Oh, you know, just wasting my 20s being miserable achieving nothing.\n\nAnd I really have achieved nothing. My one passion, for over 15 years now, has been music. I wanted to make music, to write songs, to play in a band, play on stage, record music. I never had any illusions about making money at it, it was strictly a passion because I felt a deep need to make music. I've pursued this goal without pause. I've poured thousands of dollars and thousands of hours into it. And? Nothing. Never played a concert. Never made a finished recording. Never gotten a band past shitty rehearsals. Just wrote a bunch of songs no one will ever hear. In December I developed carpal tunnel. I can still play bass for maybe 30 minutes at a stretch, but I can't play guitar anymore. The jury is still out whether I can play bass well enough to hack it in a band, but I have pain in my wrists every single day after six months of significant lifestyle changes, so I really can't say I'm optimistic there. Actually I never was, even before it was diagnosed I knew for sure what it was and fully expected it would end my musical career and, hey, I guess preemptive depression is a thing. But it's more than that. I'm trying to figure out how many bands I've started that broke up before doing anything useful...nine. It's nine. Nine times I've put myself out there, desperately searching for people, coddling their egos, managing all their schedules, finding a space to play, trying to make it all happen and then watching it crumble. That's in between trying to play in other peoples' bands that met the same fate. I don't think I'm toxic or a shitty bandmate or a totally hopeless musician but there's exactly one thing all these have in common...\n\nI guess I always thought my obit would say something a little more impressive than \"He was a former Walgreens employee and college dropout who really liked marijuana.\" But at this point for that to happen I'd have to, I dunno, kill a bunch of people or something. And that's really never been my thing, I wouldn't even want to walk in front of a train cause it's a shitty thing to do to the conductor. I think I'd find a somewhat secluded place and use an exit bag. Really don't want anyone in my family finding me. Some stranger finding me, I can live with. Well...poor choice of words, I guess.\n\nI said before I don't want to kill myself and it's true. I really don't. I want to live. But I need something to live for and I just don't see it. I know if I hustled I could get my degree in a year or so \\(which is still fucking pathetic\\). But then what? I've been miserable forever but working a corporate office job is going to fix all that? I just don't see a future where I'm happy, or fulfilled, or anything. I can see how some of my current anxieties would be addressed, but I can also very clearly see the new ones that would take their place.\n\nThere's no point to all this. Just a rant. Really needed to say some of this I guess. It would be really nice if someone read it but I can't imagine why you'd put yourself through that."}, {"author": "IConqueredLife", "creation date": "2018-05-16 15:27:30", "selftext": "It's obvious that this medical failed is absolutely plagued nowadays, with everything from placebo pharmaceuticals to made up concepts. The issue with this subreddit is that there should be more stimulating conversations on what can be done to fix this, and how this thing can be turned around, rather than endless bitching and whining.\n\nFor example, if they would actually make tests every time, such as MRI's, brain scans and blood tests to determine hormonal levels and such, the costs and strain on the medical system would be exorbitant. No country is stupid enough to validate the applicability of these tests in the field of psychiatry. In the UK, anyone can do these tests if they suffer from a mental illness, but getting them for free under the NHS would be virtually a war lost before it even began.\n\nThese are the real problems that the field of psychiatry is facing today and it is problems like these that people should address. For example, the prescription of drugs such as Adderall or Ritalin without doing DOPAMINE LEVEL TESTING BEFOREHAND. But why would governments waste money on testing every single individual if they actually need those drugs, when they can just prescribe them to everyone like candy and cash in on the profits?\n\nSee my point? The system is absolutely broken, but I don't think it should be blamed on psychiatry as a medical science, but on the money grabbing governments and ignorant fools that do everything the doc says without questioning anything, and become mindless puppets trapped in the mental healthcare system, jumping from medication to medication and diagnosis to diagnosis without any understanding of the reality around them or any certifiable way of verifying the validity of their doctor's claims.\n\nThis is exactly the reason I subbed to this subreddit.

Thats what it seemed like to me and the few friends I talked to about it (who were all actually diagnosed).\nThen I started having what all my friends told me sounded like anxiety attacks (again they all had both anxiety and panic attacks).\nSo what happens from my perspective is that first I get the jitters and start shaking or have to move around. Its like i have way to much energy and it cant get out. Then my chest gets super tight. I have asthma and its nothing like that, nor is it like there is a weight on my chest. Its more of like a contraction. Then the air gets thin like I rose in altitude. Then either the walls start closing in and I get claustrophobic, or I get like tunnel vision but only in my head, or both. And i get hot but only in my head my body is normal I just feel hot. And it takes me a while for this to stop.\nDuring one of these episodes, once and only once I started having hallucinations(i think) like I was seeing monsters or scary people/things that weren't there. Then when I would close my eyes to try to sleep or not see thing, even more scary images would pop into my head, accompanied by shear terror (example: scary clowns, i have no fear of clowns, scary or nonscary, but some clowns made appearances, and i was filled with more terror then I've ever felt before. I thought that this was the beginning of schizophrenia (first year of college, I know most adults who have it get it in college I think) but nothing like that ever happened again and that was 5ish months ago.\n\nIn the past 4-5 months this is all gotten better. I'm no longer depressed (again never diagnosed but I'm good now) and I don't have these attacks anymore. I know in the rules we're not suppose to look for or give medical advise, but that's not what I'm asking. I want to ask\n1. Does that sound like a panic attack or not?\n2. I don't seem to have these in response to anything and I always hear about anxiety being about a particular thing or a trigger. But is there like a general anxiety or like sudden onset anxiety?

I mean, if the meds aren't helping any of my negative symptoms, and they barely touch my positives, then why keep taking them? Only thing I can see that they do is make the voices turn more into static electricity, they make me dull\\(personality wise\\) and I can't think for myself. My thoughts are still being broadcasted, so I feel nothing is safe. Everybody knows of my business and I can't take this shit. \n\nOn one hand, I have the CIA controlling me through an NFC/RFID transponder, which records my thoughts, my movements,memories and has the capability to insert thoughts and actions. \n\nOn the other hand, I have the aliens broadcasting my thoughts to the world because they're pissed off at the CIA for attempting to control their property. I trust nobody, I don't even know if I trust myself. The aliens have this device where they silently connect to my chip, but it broadcasts this ultra sonic particle beam when they need to run updates, or test the functionality. I can hear this sound constantly. It's not like a tinnitus sound, but more like a cicada during mating season in the desert\\(if you recognize that sound\\).

My schizophrenic father gave them permission to insert this chip because it's his way of keeping tabs on everything I do, think,say, or feel. They're controlling my every move. Then my mother, who is actually the devil in a human skin suit is out to murder me. She's jealous of my knowledge and she wants to put a stop to it before this information is leaked to the general public. She's using my brother and my sister as human sacrifice objects, but they're immune to her torture because they don't have a chip. My sister has a brain injury, so I think that's why the aliens want no part of that, and my mother has her brainwashed so she can't think for herself anyway. She tells my sister Im a junkie, but I've never done heroin or any powdery drugs. I like my cannabis and my psychedelic drugs\\(LSD,MDMA,Pcilocybin,Mescaline/peyote\\). My mother is trying to poison me in my food. She sneaks into my house late at night when I'm asleep and shoots my food with sodium cyanide. I refuse to eat anything from anybody. I won't even eat the shit at the grocery store because she's already laced it with poison. \n\n Doctors and nurses are all in on this plot to take me down. My mom and biodad,who also has schizophrenia gave them persmission to do so, which is why they attempt to drug me up to control my mind and my body so they can silently kill me.

I'm stopping my meds, and I'm thinking about just disappearing so they can't track me. The weird part is yesterday I didn't hear these sounds, so I thought the chip was removed when I was sleeping.

I'm matthew frenette. Some of you *may* potentially maybe know me. I constantly do schizophrenia videos, about two a week, and nearly always post them on this sub.

I feel like I've said this...many times before, which kind of makes me think of insecurity - but I'd love to know what some of you think of my videos :D. I've noticed that while the occasional one gets a good amount of upvotes, I nearly never ever ever get any comments on this sub in my videos' comment sections. Make no mistake - I'm very grateful that I have helped people. It means a *lot* to me. But the insecure side of me can't stop asking if I am doing something wrong. If my videos aren't up to par compared to what they could be. Please don't mistake this as wanting compliments though. It's the opposite. I want criticisms. \n\nAnyway. For those of you who are interested in my videos, you know this. But I quit weed a few weeks back. I actually made a video a few weeks prior to announcing that exactly where I spoke upon having smoked weed for the two or three months prior to that take. One day however, about two weeks ago, something clicked inside of me and I stopped. Stopping weed is the best decision I could have made at that time and I'm very very happy I did it. Drugs and schizophrenia are a terrible combination. \n\nAnother thing - college. I may be going a year or two down the road. Very exciting stuff. I'm looking at a college currently called Dawson College. It's super cool and it's a thought that I've been entertaining (seriously considering) for the last few days. I'm planning to email the college, send them the best letter anyone's ever seen (i've always been one for hyperbole), and cross my fingers and hope they accept me. \n\nLife is pruuuuty good. My blog's panning out relatively well. I'm actually doing this thing with video games where for every game I beat I'm putting 20$ aside...so that I can buy more games. hehe. Encourages me to get off my ass and actually fucking beat my games. Like jesus. I just haven't been doing so lately. Well I have but very slowly. \n\nI've got a podcast, a blog, a youtube channel.

My delusions ranged from people plotting to eat me/kill me to me convincing myself that I caused the holocaust in some way.\nTo cope with this I started playing a game, doesnt matter too much so I wont talk about it, but basically for this game I created a mentally ill nazi vampire who I could project my delusions and hallucinations onto as a way to express myself and make myself feel better. \nFor the time being this wasnt a bad idea, up until the last maybe 2 months when I started feeling psychotic again, increase in hallucinations and the delusions coming back, depression, anxiety, panic and anger.... \nThis fictional character that I have created has not become a manifestation of my mind and it acts in a way I could only describe as an imaginary friend or a ghost thats haunting me. \nWithout going into too much detail, my own creation I made to cope with my illness is now in my brain talking to be sometimes and giving me WW2 flashbacks that I never experienced.\nSince this is not my frist time dealing with delusions I know they arent real, like I do snap out of it eventually but it is slowly taking a tole on my mind again. \nI do want to tell my parents and see my psychiatrist about it but im so scared right now and I wouldnt know how to explain this... I have nazis living in my head? I think I would be sent to an institution for something that weird.\nI do want your advice.\nDrawing was made during a semi-psychotic episode when I was home alone, few months ago."}, {"author": "UnivofReddit", "creation date": "2018-05-20 03:14:33", "selftext": "I come from a family with high prevalence of schizophrenia.

Here is a description:\n\n\"My mental stability is gradually lessening. Eventually I am going to start oscillating between intense paranoia \\(feeling like pictures of people are watching me, having out of body experiences, not desiring human contact, etc\\) and reverse feelings \\(feeling hopelessly alone, feeling trapped within my own body\\). The oscillations between paranoia symptoms and reverse paranoia symptoms occur with a period of several hours \\- like four hours of paranoia followed by four hours of reverse symptoms. This will happen for maybe a few months \\(maybe three\\-four months\\) and then go away for a few more months \\(maybe six\\-seven months\\). It has been like this for the past two years.\"\n\nI've never heard of anything like it. It's crazy, though \\- I can literally set a clock to the oscillations. And unlike with ultra rapid cycling type II bipolar, it does not cycle between happiness and sadness. When I mention cycling to my psychiatrist she says that cycling is typically type II bipolar \\(cycling between happiness and sadness\\) but I do not cycle between happiness and sadness. As part of the cycle there are also periods of really bad panic / social anxiety \\(like tightness in my chest, feeling as if I can't breath whenever I send or receive a text message or an email\\). She says that she thinks GABA has something to do with it.\n\nI have tried all sorts of antipsychotics and they only provide limited temporary relief to some of the positive paranoia symptoms but they can actually make the negative paranoia symptoms worse \\(note that when I say negative paranoia symptoms I am talking about something like the feeling you get like when you take too much of the antipsychotic Risperidone, not necessarily negative symptoms of Schizophrenia\\). Like sometimes the negative symptoms resemble taking too much Risperidone \\- like I even get the same stomach upset and acid reflux. I tried lithium and that did absolutely nothing. I tried taking Carbamazepine at the peak of one of the rapid up and down cycles and it kept on going up and down rapidly for three more days without any change so I declared Carbamazepine ineffective and weaned off it. I take some Depakote because after I started Depakote the cycling that happened in the future was less bad, but I am not 100&amp;#37; sure that Depakote works.

I'm almost 19, in college, and trying to figure out my life, which has caused a crisis. I don't have much life experience yet, and that's why I'm so terrified of dying and ceasing to exist for eternity. Like falling down a dark hole that doesn't have an end, forever. This has been happening since I was 12ish, when I lived in fear of death, and was somehow convinced that I would die at age 13 \\(I was a weird kid\\).\n\nEvery night, like clockwork, my mind starts to think about that, and it spirals into something like a panic attack. I can't fall asleep until 2 or 3 am now. I'm also scared to go to sleep at night in fear of dying in my sleep. I always think \"how can people let themselves drift off into that state of unawareness that they may never get out of so easily?\" I'm also terrified of anesthesia because of how it forces that on you. I've opted to get my wisdom teeth out awake because to me, pain is better than nothingness. \n\nIn the daytime, whenever I'm doing something fun, my brain likes to remind me that the fun thing is only a blip in my very short life, and that when I die it will all be forgotten. When I'm relaxing, watching YouTube, etc., my brain starts telling me to do work on my novel, or something productive because I only have a short amount of time and to spend it wisely.\n\nI don't even have my driver's license yet because I'm too scared to drive. And I hate asking people to drive me places because I think \"well what if we get into a car wreck and die, then it's all my fault because I wanted to go to that place.\" I scheduled my college classes two days a week because more days per week means more driving, which means more chances of an accident. This has progressed to being scared of going anywhere at all, though I still force myself to go.\n\nI check my body obsessively for signs of illness. Whenever I lose weight, it's muscular dystrophy. Whenever I notice the slightest abnormality, it's a cancerous tumor. Last year, I felt a lump in my throat when I swallowed, and literally came to terms with the fact that I would die before I could have a successful life \\(still kinda worried about that lump today\\).\n\nI also have a lot of paranoia about death. For example, when my parents divorced when I was 12, I worried that my dad would kill me to sever the connection between him and my mom for good. I never spent the night at his house, and worried about him poisoning my food. And to be honest, my dad's side of the family is really controlling and passive\\-aggressive and they have everything from bipolar to schizophrenia to OCD \\(which I believe I have as well, but that's another post\\).\n\nI know that therapy would be beneficial and I'm looking into it, but what else can I do to get my life back? I'm so scared of wasting my life that I'm actually wasting it."}, {"author": "DoomUnit_X2", "creation date": "2018-05-20 08:53:10", "selftext": "I start a new job next week.

I come off as a bit strange, but find it very easy to appear amiable and even funny.\n\nI spent the entire day with 3 people, much of the time I was feeling intense waves of dysphoria. It's like my mind was trying its hardest to comprehend what was going on. It was trying to make sense of just regular things in really abstract ways while still staying grounded.\n\nSo its like Im getting angry at myself whenever something goes wrong socially, its like I can feel my brain melting inside of my skull.\n\nAll in all I had a pretty pleasant day. A year ago today I was at home cowering under my covers.

I wonder if Ill get the professional job I want.\n\nAll I have right now is a bedroom, a breaking computer, barely enough food to eat. I dont do drugs, I dont drink, Im intelligent.

I wanted to talk about my experience so far in highschool with my PTSD, how I'm and other students with serious mental illness are treated, and how my mental health has effected my grades and work ethic.  \n\n   So I'd like to start off with talking about my experience with having PTSD in a high school environment, specifically as a freshman. So over the course of this year I'd had bad struggles with my PTSD, worse then usual, on top of that coming into this new environment has been a real struggle. I usually able to get high 80s but this year I've been close to failing most of my classes. We have support systems in my school as well as 'alternative learning' for kids with mental health though they are both not great. We have our guidance counselors though they don't deal with most things and will send you away if they 'don't deal with that sort of thing' as I was told when I was sexually harassed by another student. So besides them there are two counselors that work for the district and are sometimes in the middle school and sometimes in the high school. My experience with them is that I went to one of them, well call her E, so I went to E is the beginning of the year wanting to talk about some of my struggles. After that session she didn't call me back till about a week about, the end of the year, and totally forget I had PTSD and thought I had schizophrenia. The 'alternative learning' environments disgust me. So if you go and convince the guidance counselor that you have a bad enough mental illness to not be in regular classes they stick you in the basement of one of the elementary schools. Now I don't go to a ghetto school or anything, my school has been ranked one of the beat in the country. In my opinion, for that title you should be ensuring that ALL OF YOUR STUDENTS are accommodated for. \n\n   Next I want to talk about how people with mental illnesses are treated by staff in particular. So I usually don't feel the need to tell staff about my mental illness unless it comes up or I have a panic attack and need to explain myself. So from my experience there are a few kinds of teachers and how they react. My French teacher is nice but she over composites \nwith it. She treats me differently then all the other students and makes me feel alienated from my peers. After a while it stopped and I felt better and then she did a unit on mothers day, it was a small unit, and I had a panic attack and she freaked out and called my parents and now I feel alienated again. I'm so glad I dropped French for last year. There's my science teacher who was super cool about it and helped me with it and helped me with work. He understands because one of his friends has a similar thing. My social studies teacher is the best, she's so sweet. So we had to do this project where we wrote about an experience that changed us as a person and I wrote about my abuse and PTSD and she sent me this super sweet email about how strong I was and she much she respected me and she never treated me any differently. \n\n  Lastly I wanted to talk a bit about how my grades are doing due to worsening mental health. So last year, in my last year of middle school, I had things very controlled and it showed in my good grades. This year I spiraled. My grades have been bad, close to failing. I'm trying to fix it but its hard, I hope for a better year next year. \n\nI'm really sorry this is so long lol "}, {"author": "ShadowFlare1979", "creation date": "2018-05-21 13:14:45", "selftext": " I'm 38 single male and diagnosed with Schizophrenia at the age of 20 and for the past 15 or so years my life has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter reading the books,\u00a0\n\nGrain Brain by Dr. Perl Mutter\n\nand\n\nBrain Maker by Dr. Perl Mutter\n\nI am now free from bad health, bad bacteria, missing good bacteria hell.\n\nIn simple words, hell no more.\n\nMy mood is no longer bad.\n\nI am Gluten \\- protein sensitive and gluten damage is Schizophrenia.\n\nAnd, antipsychotics have side effects and I am forced to use them\n\nbecause of ignorance and because of bad mood caused by\n\nbad bacteria and missing good bacteria.\n\nIn a week or two antipsychotics will be discontinued as the\n\ntime is required to convince my parents and the psychiatrist.\n\nSo it was never a disease.\n\nMy Schizophrenia is or is equal to \" Gluten \\- protein sensitivity \\+ bad bacteria and missing good bacteria.\n\nThanks to Dr. Perl Mutter and his books, I am in heaven.\n\nThanks.

Cuz I feel tired in the day power through it and refocuse because it's so easy to say no I actually need to do this now but I can't do that during my come down when I need sleep.\nAnything helps as I just started 4 days ago. I Didn't take anything in hopes of actually getting sleep so we will see how tonight goes but I feel like trash cuz I'm so tired\n\nShort story. new diagnos and brand new to the  meds, adderall xr.  I haven't slept well and dont sleep till late at night (like 1-2am if taken around 9-11am) how do people sleep as they start to crash (and for me) as their mind starts to wonder about agian?"}, {"author": "Dodgeshawndra", "creation date": "2018-05-22 02:17:23", "selftext": "For years it was all about a provocation and something that occurred a while back.

Right before this happened a weird link popped up on my phone called Operant Conditioning. Basically it allows for behavior modification and I guess it removes unliked and unwanted behavior. I talked to myself a hell of a lot. I stopped doing that. I used to think there were people investigating me. I rarely think that now. I thought there were aliens and stuff, it's all in back of my mind now. It's fixing stuff without fixing the main issue, schizophrenia.\n\nWhile this is good it is still ongoing and not perfected. I am on the daily pretty annoyed by hallucinations. My behavior is more tolerable to everyone else... It's a slow process and build.

He was arrested abroad for damaging hotel property. He was also accused for having 15 different suitcases with him with several computers containing different numeric codes. He was accused also for harassing innocent bystanders calling them assassins and the like.\n\nIm the only relative that has stayed in contact with him but all of this was really taking a toll on me and I haven\u2019t spoken to him (we communicate via email because he uses an anonymous address) in about a month now.\n\nHe\u2019s still in a delusional state and kept saying crazy things to me about being harassed and targeted.

I have my own fixed ideas about things I want to make and how I think they should be made, because I think they are not made yet, and they should be built because some people might have an interest in them. That's just an opinion I hold over certain things.\n\nGenerally and to make it simple, implementation and technical details can matter more than you would think, and often get skipped because technical people are not listened to. They are either psycho rigid, or don't have ambition, or don't really bother trying new things because it can be non trivial work, or just don't have time to build new things because it's a lot of time and money.\n\nI love engineering and applied sciences in general. I am not fond of big theories or the very high abstraction of math and theoretical physics. But I love it when it can be used to build new things, like a new type of rocket technology.\n\nI failed at becoming an engineer in my school years. Being a creative type, I also have horrendous discipline. I don't work on something until it is attracting my interest.

A real TL;DR situation, so I apologise. The worst part was admitting to myself, so I'm quite content with however people respond. It would be nice to know I'd touched on some things that are relateable, or at least that make sense.... anyway, here goes.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart and fearful trepidation that I commit to public \\(of a sort\\) words the growing inner suspicion of my latent schizoid self. In the pity lottery of social media self\\-help sloganry, there's everything from the big hitters \\(the cancers, those 1\\-in\\-a\\-million childhood genetic disorders\\) through to the newly minted mental health acceptance. All sorts of mood disorders \\- depression, PTSD, anxiety, bipolar disorder \\- which are largely emotional, and perhaps stray once in a while into something deeper, they're positively trendy. No fun to admit to, even less fun to suffer from, but at least to be met with decency, acceptance and kindness from most. Schizophrenia on the other hand... not a feel good story. \n\nSchizophrenia is not empowering. Schizophrenia does not elicit the sympathy of well wishers. Schizophrenia doesn't get the Hallmark greeting card treatment with self\\-help pep talk clich\u00e9s. It is, in every regard, wholly unsuitable conversation at dinner parties \\- as other issues of psychological and cognitive health once were. That fact alone should give me hope, but I feel only certain despair at the damage such an announcement would do to mine or anyone's reputation should a real person be attached to it. \n\nAnd I don't blame anyone, either. I'd have wanted to turn tail and politely power walk \\-or if need be, shamelessly sprint \\- away from such a subject and such a person. Padded cells and straitjackets are all the mind's eye can conjure for such a proclamation: \"Oh, right, well they're insane. They'll never be able to hold a decent conversation. They'll completely unnerve me. Best avoid\" \n\nI want to share with people what may be the earliest, and I would argue quite logical, beginnings to what may well turn out to be full\\-blown psychosis, mental breakdown and cognitive dissolution, probably one of the most terrifying prospects for someone whose identity is so inexorably woven into his intelligence, his analytical reasoning, his intellectual curiosity. If I can't sit back and consider the world and be cogent about it, if am just a blathering, incoherent, paranoid wreck, then I am nothing. To see the battle lines being drawn between pure logic and sensory input, I am already unsettled. \n\nLet me explain how that works \\(for me, at least\\). Our brains are fantastically capable evolutionary gifts, unparalleled as far as we can tell, throughout the animal kingdom. Sensorily, however, we are vastly outperformed in every regard \\- olfactorily, gustatorily, kinaesthetically, auditorily, visually \\- by a variety of species and in innumerable ways, from the auditory wizardry of echolocating bats to the binocular vision of the humble dragonfly, receiving millions of times more visuospatial data than the human eyes deliver to our brain. And that is the difference, despite our obvious inferiority \\- the feeble data, the relative crumbs from the sensory table that we do pick up, are made advantageous by the unique power of reasoning. But without sensory input, we cannot reason, we are reduced to an extraordinarily vulnerable prey on the scale of predatory soft targets. And thus we are deeply reliant on the sensory input we receive, and schizophrenia essentially destroys the myth that you can rely upon this sensory input to make decisions. \n\nThis is a more fundamental breakdown in cognition than those who have yet to experience it would realise: the slow erosion of the axiomatic dependabilty of your own senses must ultimately result in the loss of the ability to reason whatsoever. Take my own schizotypal murmurings \\- I have started to hear my mother and my girlfriend sobbing in another room to me. We're both in the same building, and they've usually gone quiet for a while \\(long enough for a rapid change in emotion from our previous cheery conversation not that long before\\) and I am usually deep in thoughts of self\\-loathing. This has advanced from simple self\\-doubt and recrimination, from admonishments about mistakes I've made or stupid things I've said, to reflections on my wider shortcomings and eventually, to here, the certain conviction in my own worthlessness and horrible failings as a person. I can see how this guilt \\- for no particular reason, just the guilt that comes from the knowledge I'm me \\- transposes from a horrifying internal pressure and anxiety to an externalised force \\- the sobbing represents how I imagine they must feel to be around me. I'll ask if they're okay \\- airy, light response as before. Not the slightest hint of sadness. Or I'll walk in unannounced, convinced of course that their acting skills have clearly improved and they gave a Tony\\-winning performance to hide their obvious pain at being connected to me, but there again \\- not a reddened eye, not a moistened cheek, not a sniffling nose, not a croaking voice, not a single shred of evidence that they had been, just a moment prior, crying hysterically because I'd disappointed them so much. \n\nEven now, as I am able to abstract this deeply muddled emotional reasoning into something logically and objectively absurd, even as I sometimes tell myself when I hear the noise start up, I can't help but feel my heartrate elevate, my breathing quicken, my sense of shame deepen: I've caused their misery. I can't divorce this crippling self\\-disgust from my sensory input, and therefore any reasoning based upon it. Maybe I can win the battle of wills and convince myself to relax, take a deep breath, and see it for the obvious illusion it is: but the shame, so critical to the nature of the phantom sounds themselves, prevent me from explaining myself to people. Maybe their sympathetic understanding can nullify my paranoid fears, maybe we could even turn it into a running joke \\- \"look, see, not crying! Do you believe me yet?\" \\- and I could resolve everything with ease. \n\nBut I *know* that apart from being perplexingly illogical and difficult to follow \\- I don't think they would quite believe that I can believe something as demented this wholeheartedly \\- it's actually more than just alienating, it's unnerving. Unsettling. Frightening, even. It's so far from the bounds of normal interaction, of normal relationships we have with our sensory inputs, so far removed from what the average person considers healthy thought processes, that they will already think I've lost it. It'll be tremendously upsetting, heart\\-wrenching and painful a revelation, so awful an experience to subject them to, that I'd damn well turn it into a self\\-fulfilling prophecy. They would spend their nights sobbing quietly, albeit for more reassuring reasons of sympathy \\- but still, if their wellbeing and contentedness is such an overriding pscyhological concern, how could I possibly countenance doing such a thing to them? And it is this desire to protect people \\- and protect myself from people's judgements \\- that I couldn't possibly consider honesty.\n\nThe one logical safe room I can still absolutely rely on, is the grasp on how abnormal and incomprehensible this whole way of thinking is. I know that if I just lock it away, I can be normal. And for now that works a treat \\- although even just writing this has been incredibly relieving, an impossible weight from the shoulders lifted \\- and even though I can feel myself retreating inwards, slowly backing away from social gatherings of all kinds, finding even ordinary conversations a torturous endurance test because I can no longer rely on my reading of social clues, I can no longer rely on what I see and hear to guage how people react, because I see negative so much of the time and that contributes to my distress and self\\-criticism, and because to cope I've already admitted to myself that my senses \\- that most basic element of human reasoning \\- can't be trusted, in a way I am allowing the demented delusions to fill the vaccuum and take over. \n\nI can envisage a shortened lifespan, physical complications, emotional trauma, psychological breakdown as well as cognitive dysfunction, as I perpetually oscillate between extreme stress and anxiety at the abject horror of how badly every social interaction goes, no matter the evidence to the contrary \\(which I am simply no longer able to process, I can't tell the objectively real from the neurotically imagined\\) and the technique to calm myself that amounts to repeating the mantra \"It's not real, it's just your emotional imagination, just ignore it\" which I can see, in terms of the bigger picture, contributing to the larger breakdown in reality that will be my schizophrenic undoing: and hence my opening gambit. You cannot function without faith in your sensory inputs. Many enjoy temporary experimentation \\- the visions on hallucinogenic drugs, the intrigues of blackout chambers, the daring courage \\(or stupidity\\) of consuming something hideously foul such as a chili pepper that scorches the tongue, or any game played blindfolded, where the novelty of reliance upon sense of touch is comical unto itself: the fun is always to be had in the contrast between normal everyday reality, steadfast and unchanging, and this mixed up world of sensory illusion. \n\nThe dawning realisation, however, that the disorientation and illusory uncertainty has a degree of permenance, is so traumatic, disturbing and destructive that it is what leads to a schizophrenic unravelling. I just hope that, if ever such a horror takes place in my life, that these writings are preserved, if not for my own grasping in the dark for a sense of reality again, then for the horrified onlookers to whatever crazed and incoherent behaviour I'm exhibiting: there was once a sane, thoughtful, perceptive mind in here. He may be slipping away, perhaps forever; but he was once present, and on the precipice between madness and mindfulness, he looked upon the same sight every bit as horrified and uncomprehending as they might be.

I don't know what I'm failing to say, I always include the basic \"I see/hear stuff\" to lead into discussion, but the new doctor ignored that entirely and focused on asking me about my mom, why I want to in his words \"wipe my hands of her\" (the reason being because she shot my esa dog that my grandparents helped me adopt and killed her because that's legal where I live so long as the dog is old and dies instantly, and forced me to watch, this was punishment for saying they loved me more than she did) he then got overly focused on my being gay and started chalking my problems up to being spoiled and gay.

My dad threw a huge fit saying how young I was, there was no way that was an accurate diagnosis,, so they re-diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. I was on meds until about 16 years old (Abilify and some other I can\u2019t recall).\nFast forward a couple years I\u2019ve developed a drug and alcohol problem. I never really became addicted to anything, just abused whatever I could. The most recent being meth, I finally stopped used everything when I was about 22. I stayed sober for about a year when I was diagnosed with endometriosis, where I began to use pills again. Not to abuse but for actual pain. \n\nFast forward some more to recent months,, I\u2019ve had a lot of awful episodes involving anxiety and depression. I had three panic attacks last week alone at work and I\u2019m fearful of losing my job to due my mental instability. I noticed my anxiety come into full swing maybe a year or so ago, i figured it came with my endometriosis and being in pain 90% of the time. But my depression has come back with a vengeance this past month; I\u2019m accustomed to the sad feelings and thoughts but am usually able to push them away after a bit. These just keep lingering. \nFor the first time in nearly 10 years I self harmed... while at work... due to overwhelming anxiety. I\u2019m a smoker, so I have a lighter on me always. The first few burns were enough to take the edge off,, barely even leaving a mark. By the third panic attack,, I ended up \u2018over doing\u2019 it in a sense,, this was a more serious burn. And looking at it now all I can think is \u201cWhy??\u201d Why did i do that... sure it helped in the moment when I sat on the bathroom floor bawling my eyes out over literally nothing.... but a week later it\u2019s just a painful reminder of how low I let myself get. \n\nLooking back at the past 4 1/2 years I\u2019ve spent with my significant other I can recall all the mood swings and outbursts I\u2019ve put him thru, the random crying and screaming in frustration and it makes me think.... am I getting worse?? For so long i thought I had been managing my BPD and here I am feeling strange in my own body wondering how much more I can take.\nThe suicidal thoughts are more frequent (not that I\u2019d actually take my own life), I feel more drained with less even going on, my anxiety is thru the roof... at least once a day I experience disassociation, unfortunately most often when I\u2019m driving. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore,, obviously I want to see a therapist but in the mean time I don\u2019t want things to digress to the point where I lose my job, lose the one constant (my boyfriend) in my life, and result back to using again.

In that time I adopted a cat, a month after that I was back together with him(abuser). \nI was suffocating again, and was back at being pushed around. One night I just start to cry, all the while he's sleeping. He then woke up angry due to the fact I was sad and had a hard time getting words out. \nEverything escalated very quickly, and he started yelling and screaming why I did this to him, all the while he's taking an overdose on truxal. I called the police to try and get some help, cause he was trying to kill himself right! When the police came I kinda expected them to take him to the hospital and get him help, but no. Instead they took him to the detention, and sat him free after 2 hours. He arrives home, and lashes out at me, there he managed to bite a hole in my wrist, bite me several places around the body, and nearly strangling me to unconsciousness. I managed to do self defense and get him of me. \nHe threw a pc in anger, and it nearly hit my cat. That's when I realised I had to get him out, I couldn't care less if I died that night, but i would never make anyone else suffer because of him. \nAfter the night I left my ex boyfriend, I was so overwhelmed with good and bad emotions, cause even though I broke free, I didn't know who I was. \nI'm really sorry or long and maybe a bit confusing post.\nI'm just frustrated, sad and angry. It hurts me that I can't get him out of my head, the fact that I feel as a failure all the time.

I know I shouldn't blame myself for what happened or that my recovery isn't done yet.

I'm very hard on myself as a result of that because not everything I do is great. Sometimes I'll make a mediocre product, and therefore will think of myself as a mediocre creative. It's short-sighted to the point where it's comedic, which contrasts pretty heavily with my motivation, which is long lasting. As a result of my constant judgment upon myself, I'm prone to feeling like I'm not talented, which is a pretty shitty feeling. \n\nAnother thing is that I've kind of been burning myself out lately.

Although I count playing video games (of which I play about 3 hours a day, more or less), which I know is very very odd. I should just count the reviews I write for them time-wise. But I think it's because I focus on a game a lot when playing it as to analyze it and come to conclusions about it. Also there's my schizophrenia that makes tasks that should be easy pretty challenging. \n\nI've been noticing something over the last few months. I've seen countless times people that have been on here and then left, and I used to constantly ask myself why.

And I love doing it. But I see more opportunity in mental health. I feel there's a potential market there that hasn't been tapped into to the fullest degree yet. Schizo can actually be very interesting if you are open minded.\n\nUltimately though, working on mental health awareness really gives me the opportunity to help. There are a lot of faces to the entertainment industry, there aren't much to mental health - especially schizophrenia. I therefore feel the need to get the word out there.

He really wants to come off antipsychotics and I was wondering what your thoughts are.\n\nMy dad had his first psychotic episode after being fired from his job at 36. He had delusions (thinking that everyone in Manhattan was out to get him) and auditory+visual hallucinations. My mom made him go see the doctor and he was put on Risperidone which completely diminished these symptoms. He tapered off after a year (with an ok from the doctor).\n\nHis second psychosis happened last year (at age 56). He was going through midlife crisis and we noticed him gradually withdrawing himself socially. After some point, he began spending all his day in his room, not showering, barely sleeping, barely eating, and not talking to anyone. I would sometimes run into him when he came out to use the bathroom, but he just seemed very off and distant/emotionally absent. This went on for 2~3 months until one day, he broke out in full psychosis. He began questioning my mom because he thought she had poisoned his food. He also later told us that he was having auditory hallucinations (voices from grandpa who passed away long ago). He ran away from our house barefooted because he thought we were trying to kill him. We called 911 and he was taken to an inpatient facility by the police where he stayed there for the mandatory 72 hours. During his stay, he was put on Olanzapine which again got rid of all the positive and negative symptoms. He has been on it for a year now.\n\nI'm certainly not a medical professional, but I am skeptical about his diagnosis because:\n\n1. His age of onset was 36, and I've read that symptoms typically first appear around early to mid 20s in men.

I actually didn't know he was schizophrenic until the second psychosis because neither of my parents told me.\n\n2. I've read that most schizophrenic people have hard time adapting to society, but my dad is quite successful in his field (B.S. from Harvard, M.S. and Ph.D from Columbia, had multiple engineering journals accepted for publication, etc.). He also worked as an electrical engineer for quite a long time before he decided to retire early. \n\n3. It's only happened twice in his life, 20 years apart, and both under extreme stress which I believe was the cause.\n\n4. No family history of schizophrenia.\n\nHonestly I don't really care either way, but the problem is that my dad is very miserable on medication. He doesn't suffer from typical side effects like weight gain, but he says that his memory and the ability to focus are completely destroyed when he's on antipsychotics (both risperidone and olanzapine). Because he has retired, he spends most of his time reading engineering papers/journals and learning new things. However, he says he can't no longer think and feels like his brain has frozen. He seemed defeated and cried the other day which broke my heart since I've never seen him cry before. He wants to come off medication and I just want him to be happy. I've told him it wouldn't hurt to ask, but my dad is a very shy/non-confrontational person, and is afraid to bring it up with the psychiatrist. I am wondering what your thoughts are and how he could approach the psychiatrist about this issue.\n\n"}, {"author": "paranormalreality", "creation date": "2018-05-25 00:00:25", "selftext": "I'm a 23 year old white female.

My uncle has schizophrenia which i'm terrified of inheriting.

I was very close to this person and had no inkling they were suicidal or depressed. Like me they appeared so jolly from the outside. This took an enormous toll on me, and sent me into the longest and worst depressive/drug use episodes of my life until now, which lasted most of last year until november or so.\n\nSeveral years ago I had sex with a friend which resulted in an abnormal friendship where they were manipulative and threatened me with self harm. They were very mentally ill and depended on me so much it was scary.

I had never even seen a baby in person before my own. My dad had no clue who he was even signing me over to. He didn't know I was pregnant, he had never met my boyfriend or his dad...

If I do it like that I can concentrate much better at work and Overall and at the end of the day I feel like I don't really Need it anyway.\n\nI managed to do it like that for a year now just to f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* survive the garbage.\n\n.\n\nAnd somehow god damn out of nowhere Comes that Girl...\n\nThe first time I saw her I just looked away because I just know im not Ready for something like that.

It mainly focuses on times I've been paranoid, or times I've seen/visualized things as something else. Examples:\n\n- when slacking off at work thinking \"what if there's cameras in the office or internet tracking software\"\n- when having a bad intrusive thought thinking \"what if someone around me can read my thoughts and thinks I'm crazy\"\n- seeing the silhouette of something really far away and imagining it's something else ~ like a door stopper from very far away looks like the shape of a bird, or a sand bag propped in the shape of a cat (these things are always far away while walking or driving and I haven't had my prescription updated in over a year)\n- when leaving for work or a vacation &amp; I see someone walking or biking by our house as we are preparing to leave I sometimes think \"what if they see us leaving and come back to burgle our house?\"\n- when at a restaurant thinking \"What if I leave the 'customer copy' of a receipt blank and the waitress writes in a much higher number?\"\n\nThese are just a couple of examples that make me fear I'm paranoid/delusional or on the edge of hallucinating things. There are other ones along those same lines that pop up on random occasions that I don't necessarily believe 100% but the possibility still causes me anxiety. Then the fact that they cause me anxiety causes me even more anxiety after the fact wondering if these are paranoid or delusional thoughts.\n\nI've talked to my therapist about these mental illness fears in the past but fear I may have left something out or not brought up these examples in clear enough detail. She does not believe I have schizophrenia.\n\nI know this may be reassurance seeking and that I need to accept the possibility. I'm just terrified that paranoia isn't a symptom of OCD and my poor vision can't explain the minor visual imaginings (not even hallucinations just premature constructions of shapes/outlines) and that I'm not taking appropriate action to combat a much deeper mental illness.\n\nAnyone?"}, {"author": "gurneyhallack", "creation date": "2018-05-27 19:08:21", "selftext": "Hello. I am new here, but I thought I would share a a bit of my story. I came onto Reddit three months ago for the survivor subs. I have been in therapy five months, and it has helped a great deal. I never sought any help before, I had one bad experience with therapy a decade ago, and never went back, I didn't figure I was helpable. I am thirty seven, and have autism and PTSD, as well as the depression and anxiety, though those are getting better. When I was growing up, things were difficult. My father was a heroin addict and career criminal, and back then, my mother was the type of quiet girl who would not say shit. We moved thirty one times in my first eighteen years. When I was eight I was raped on five occasions by a man. \n\nIt was the point the bullying started to get really bad, they would punch, kick, throw stones, lock you inside things. I found a spot, a clearing in the woods, to hide. It was a tiny rural town, and I read detective stories, I figured out that the lack of detritus boys leave, little toys and whatnot, meant the other boys had not found this place. I went back to the spot maybe fifty or sixty times over that summer. He just showed up randomly five times, some farmer or something, I will never know. I would get so involved in my book, encyclopedia brown and Nancy Drew at that point, I did not notice him approaching until he was right there. \n\nThe first time, he only took off my clothes and fingered me. Afterword, he talked. About what a bitch his ex wife was, about some other boy he molested, about work. He made a very convincing case for why I should not tell, that my family would be broken up and us all placed in care, and this would happen more and be worse there. The second time he raped me orally. The third through fifth time were worse, he took me each way then, orally, from behind, on top like a girl, talking about his personal shit in between until he was ready again. \n\nThe fourth and fifth time he took pictures with an old polaroid camera. Get in this position and that, etc. I started acting out at home, though I never told anyone. I set a fire and I panicked, but I got it out. I broke some windows of a building, stole a pop from a store, and popped a blow up pool of a smaller girl. I still feel bad about that one, the way she cried. My parents knew the autism was a thing, though what it was, the name, they did not yet know. So they sent me to a live in hospital for six months. I was going to tell someone there, a kindly teacher figure, but the circumstances scared me. There were ten kids in our unit, and they treated most of us nice, but there was a girl, and they were not nice to her. Not unprofessional, just cold and robotic. She was bad, she would run away, grab the men sexually, she was eleven but it would take four grown men to restrain her safely. She used teeth and hands as claws. \n\nShe would tell trauma stories in hideous detail, laughing with a bitterness I have rarely heard in an adult. I was the only one she would talk to. I just got it, I mostly listened, I was still, and I never ever touched her. After six months, soon after I turned nine, they talked to me about going home. They left it up to me, but I was so excited, I did not think of her. When she heard, she locked herself in her room for a week. They needed all manner of threats to get her to come out and eat, at the end they simply refused to feed her if she did not come to the dining room. \n\nSo she did, and pushed a chair against a wall of the dining romm and stared at it, looking at nobody. I never saw her again. When I was eleven my uncle and cousin, who were thirty and nine, died in a housefire. Though our house was imperfect, the judge figured with a husband, wife and three kids, it was better for my surviving cousin, who was seven, to live with us rather than his mother, who was a kind lady, but a bad drunk. Dad treated him very badly, him and his brother had been very close, but he hated his wife, and they had rarely seen each other in the last five years. Dad seemed to take this out on the cousin. \n\nHe always treated him worse, assumed worse of him. He was a firm believer in spanking for me and my two younger sisters, but he rarely beat us. He beat him like a rag doll. This was made more so by the cousin being a fighter, a tough kid always getting into trouble. Later the year I was eleven, my father and an uncle burned our house down as an insurance scam. They got away with it, he sent us to stay the night at a friends house. Then called us out to see it, the whole family, to watch the fire trucks and the house burn. \n\nThe cousins hand in mine squeezing, his fear, is not something I can forget. After three years the cousin's mother got better, and he moved with her. Dad never let us see him again, and I only reconnected with him through facebook three years ago. My parents divorced at twelve, and my mother got with a prick who took emotional abuse to a new level. The bullying continued apace until fourteen, and the schools added zero tolerance policies. I was molested again when I was thirteen. We had a house on the beach, poor though we were, dad always seemed to be able to talk himself into good things, and I would walk up the beach miles, I liked long walks. \n\nIt was a public bathroom, it was very early morning, and there was nobody around. He simply shoved me in a stall, shoved his hands down my pants, and fiddled around. He told me that I was lucky I didn't get hard or he would have raped me, and left. When I was fifteen, dad got bad. He had bought us kids fine bedroom sets, fine beds, dressers, a television set, a super nintendo etc. One day we got home and everything was gone, replaced by the cheapest charity versions of what we had had. \n\nHe got worse, became suicidal. and sent us to live with an aunt, he went across the country to get clean. He didn't, and the aunt grew tired of us kids, getting rid of the one sister after two months, the other after four, and me after six. When I got to the big city my father and two sisters were living in, it was a gang riddled slum. He had had many people living in the house, my sisters will not talk about anything that happened in those months. There was nothing in the apartment, a mattress the girls shared, some clothes, a couch and coffee table, nothing else. My mother had moved to that side of the country since, and I phoned everybody. \n\nAbout a month after I got there, she kidnapped us technically to regain custody. We were living in that part of the country when I turned sixteen. That was the last time I was molested. I walked four miles to a mall, and was tired walking back and took a ride. The guy fiddled around, same as before, and called it fare for the ride. During those years there was constant partying, wild drug parties, in the house. There were other fires, suicides, and OD's. When I was eighteen, living back in the town I am in now, me and my father got an apartment together as adult roommates. \n\nDuring that my favorite uncle died in a drunken car crash, and a sweet old man I knew well, I sat in his house dozens of times to buy dope for dad, got stabbed to death over an attempt to steal twelve beers. That lasted four and a half years, but dad was a heroin addict, and one day I got up and he was stone dead. I was twenty two. I moved a hundred miles north six months later, to a town I had lived in and had a friend. I was OK for quite a few years, moved a lot, and poor, but I made friends, mostly by dealing grass, but still. At twenty eight I got a place with a friend. We lived together five years. \n\nThe first two were good, but the third got hard, and the last two were bad. He had schizophrenia, and I have autism. We started being gay, kinda. Spooning, kissing, hugging. But I could not be gay for him. I loved him, I tried to dredge up gay feelings sexually, looked at gay porn, but I just could not be that for him. The last two years it was awful. Hiding in rooms, banging on doors, constant yelling and sniping. threatening suicide, potential suicide pacts. In the last six months it got worse. The med changes stopped working, he started thinking people were coming into the apartment, watching in cars outside, hearing things. \n\nIt was when he started seeing UFO's I realized this was hurting him. I gave him two months notice, but he was so mad. He would not discuss me helping him get a place, just blew up. At the last two weeks he gpt scared of homelessness and begged me to find him a place. I did not know what to do. I have so little, with a bit more time it would have been easier, I found him a cottage in the nest town over where I would be living, but he did not want to leave the town because of his mother. \n\nSo all I could find him was a room in a boarding house. It was an awful place. We kept talking for a month, but at that point, he was at his mothers when I visited, I visited every day, taking the link bus between towns. He told me never to contact him again, not to cry in front of his mother, it was over. When someone says that, decent society says to obey that, so I did not contact him. A month after that, he had pushed a dresser in front of the door of his room in the boarding house, and was on his meds, and set himself on fire sleeping. \n\nHe lived, but him and another man were badly burned.After a month he was released from the hospital, and I did visit his mothers once more. She said she had always liked me, took my contact info, but said he would never contact me. She was right, he never did. After that, I began drinking quite heavily. I do not know if the drinking caused the memories from childhood that I thought I had dealt with or what. Over the next four years of everyday drunkenness I fucked up everything. Lost most of my friendships, became a sad whining idiot. \n\nAt that point, a year ago I jumped off a bridge. That was the point I decided to get help. Things are getting better, addiction counseling for ten months, therapy for five. I am two credits from finishing highschool, getting my drivers license, got my first part time job. Three weeks ago I was layed off from my job until September, and my therapist is taking literally nothing until then, with both of us simply assuming and hoping I do in fact get my job back. Anyway, this is long, but I wanted to tell the basic core of my story.

I never saw her again. When I was eleven my uncle and cousin, who were thirty and nine, died in a housefire. Though our house was imperfect, the judge figured with a husband, wife and three kids, it was better for my surviving cousin, who was seven, to live with us rather than his mother, who was a kind lady, but a bad drunk. Dad treated him very badly, him and his brother had been very close, but he hated his wife, and they had rarely seen each other in the last five years. Dad seemed to take this out on the cousin.\n\nHe always treated him worse, assumed worse of him. He was a firm believer in spanking for me and my two younger sisters, but he rarely beat us. He beat him like a rag doll. This was made more so by the cousin being a fighter, a tough kid always getting into trouble. Later the year I was eleven, my father and an uncle burned our house down as an insurance scam. They got away with it, he sent us to stay the night at a friends house. Then called us out to see it, the whole family, to watch the fire trucks and the house burn.\n\nThe cousins hand in mine squeezing, his fear, is not something I can forget. After three years the cousin's mother got better, and he moved with her. Dad never let us see him again, and I only reconnected with him through facebook three years ago. My parents divorced at twelve, and my mother got with a prick who took emotional abuse to a new level. The bullying continued apace until fourteen, and the schools added zero tolerance policies. I was molested again when I was thirteen. We had a house on the beach, poor though we were, dad always seemed to be able to talk himself into good things, and I would walk up the beach miles, I liked long walks.\n\nIt was a public bathroom, it was very early morning, and there was nobody around. He simply shoved me in a stall, shoved his hands down my pants, and fiddled around. He told me that I was lucky I didn't get hard or he would have raped me, and left. When I was fifteen, dad got bad. He had bought us kids fine bedroom sets, fine beds, dressers, a television set, a super nintendo etc. One day we got home and everything was gone, replaced by the cheapest charity versions of what we had had.\n\nHe got worse, became suicidal. and sent us to live with an aunt, he went across the country to get clean. He didn't, and the aunt grew tired of us kids, getting rid of the one sister after two months, the other after four, and me after six. When I got to the big city my father and two sisters were living in, it was a gang riddled slum. He had had many people living in the house, my sisters will not talk about anything that happened in those months. There was nothing in the apartment, a mattress the girls shared, some clothes, a couch and coffee table, nothing else. My mother had moved to that side of the country since, and I phoned everybody.\n\nAbout a month after I got there, she kidnapped us technically to regain custody. We were living in that part of the country when I turned sixteen. That was the last time I was molested. I walked four miles to a mall, and was tired walking back and took a ride. The guy fiddled around, same as before, and called it fare for the ride. During those years there was constant partying, wild drug parties, in the house. There were other fires, suicides, and OD's. When I was eighteen, living back in the town I am in now, me and my father got an apartment together as adult roommates.\n\nDuring that my favorite uncle died in a drunken car crash, and a sweet old man I knew well, I sat in his house dozens of times to buy dope for dad, got stabbed to death over an attempt to steal twelve beers. That lasted four and a half years, but dad was a heroin addict, and one day I got up and he was stone dead. I was twenty two. I moved a hundred miles north six months later, to a town I had lived in and had a friend. I was OK for quite a few years, moved a lot, and poor, but I made friends, mostly by dealing grass, but still. At twenty eight I got a place with a friend. We lived together five years.\n\nThe first two were good, but the third got hard, and the last two were bad. He had schizophrenia, and I have autism. We started being gay, kinda. Spooning, kissing, hugging. But I could not be gay for him. I loved him, I tried to dredge up gay feelings sexually, looked at gay porn, but I just could not be that for him. The last two years it was awful. Hiding in rooms, banging on doors, constant yelling and sniping. threatening suicide, potential suicide pacts. In the last six months it got worse. The med changes stopped working, he started thinking people were coming into the apartment, watching in cars outside, hearing things.\n\nIt was when he started seeing UFO's I realized this was hurting him. I gave him two months notice, but he was so mad. He would not discuss me helping him get a place, just blew up. At the last two weeks he gpt scared of homelessness and begged me to find him a place. I did not know what to do. I have so little, with a bit more time it would have been easier, I found him a cottage in the nest town over where I would be living, but he did not want to leave the town because of his mother.\n\nSo all I could find him was a room in a boarding house. It was an awful place. We kept talking for a month, but at that point, he was at his mothers when I visited, I visited every day, taking the link bus between towns. He told me never to contact him again, not to cry in front of his mother, it was over. When someone says that, decent society says to obey that, so I did not contact him. A month after that, he had pushed a dresser in front of the door of his room in the boarding house, and was on his meds, and set himself on fire sleeping.\n\nHe lived, but him and another man were badly burned.After a month he was released from the hospital, and I did visit his mothers once more. She said she had always liked me, took my contact info, but said he would never contact me. She was right, he never did. After that, I began drinking quite heavily. I do not know if the drinking caused the memories from childhood that I thought I had dealt with or what. Over the next four years of everyday drunkenness I fucked up everything. Lost most of my friendships, became a sad whining idiot.\n\nAt that point, a year ago I jumped off a bridge. That was the point I decided to get help. Things are getting better, addiction counseling for ten months, therapy for five. I am two credits from finishing highschool, getting my drivers license, got my first part time job. Three weeks ago I was layed off from my job until September, and my therapist is taking literally nothing until then, with both of us simply assuming and hoping I do in fact get my job back.

I am new here, but I thought I would share a a bit of my story. I came onto Reddit three months ago for the survivor subs. I have been in therapy five months, and it has helped a great deal. I never sought any help before, I had one bad experience with therapy a decade ago, and never went back, I didn't figure I was helpable. I am thirty seven, and have autism and PTSD, as well as the depression and anxiety, though those are getting better. When I was growing up, things were difficult. My father was a heroin addict and career criminal, and back then, my mother was the type of quiet girl who would not say shit. We moved thirty one times in my first eighteen years. When I was eight I was raped on five occasions by a man.\n\nIt was the point the bullying started to get really bad, they would punch, kick, throw stones, lock you inside things. I found a spot, a clearing in the woods, to hide. It was a tiny rural town, and I read detective stories, I figured out that the lack of detritus boys leave, little toys and whatnot, meant the other boys had not found this place. I went back to the spot maybe fifty or sixty times over that summer. He just showed up randomly five times, some farmer or something, I will never know. I would get so involved in my book, encyclopedia brown and Nancy Drew at that point, I did not notice him approaching until he was right there.\n\nThe first time, he only took off my clothes and fingered me. Afterword, he talked. About what a bitch his ex wife was, about some other boy he molested, about work. He made a very convincing case for why I should not tell, that my family would be broken up and us all placed in care, and this would happen more and be worse there. The second time he raped me orally. The third through fifth time were worse, he took me each way then, orally, from behind, on top like a girl, talking about his personal shit in between until he was ready again.\n\nThe fourth and fifth time he took pictures with an old polaroid camera. Get in this position and that, etc. I started acting out at home, though I never told anyone. I set a fire and I panicked, but I got it out. I broke some windows of a building, stole a pop from a store, and popped a blow up pool of a smaller girl. I still feel bad about that one, the way she cried. My parents knew the autism was a thing, though what it was, the name, they did not yet know. So they sent me to a live in hospital for six months. I was going to tell someone there, a kindly teacher figure, but the circumstances scared me. There were ten kids in our unit, and they treated most of us nice, but there was a girl, and they were not nice to her. Not unprofessional, just cold and robotic. She was bad, she would run away, grab the men sexually, she was eleven but it would take four grown men to restrain her safely. She used teeth and hands as claws.\n\nShe would tell trauma stories in hideous detail, laughing with a bitterness I have rarely heard in an adult. I was the only one she would talk to. I just got it, I mostly listened, I was still, and I never ever touched her. After six months, soon after I turned nine, they talked to me about going home. They left it up to me, but I was so excited, I did not think of her. When she heard, she locked herself in her room for a week. They needed all manner of threats to get her to come out and eat, at the end they simply refused to feed her if she did not come to the dining room.\n\nSo she did, and pushed a chair against a wall of the dining romm and stared at it, looking at nobody.

It has been a living hell, and we are making no progress with him at all.\n\nSome background:\n\nHis delusions revolve around a lot of things, a lot of times some random girl he becomes fixated upon, which has happened 3 times now and have ended in a restraining order on more than one occasion. Right now he is desperate to be in a relationship with someone from a few towns older who is only 17, even though she doesn\u2019t like him or anything. There\u2019s a ton of backlash from that of course and he\u2019s been called a pedophile by the kids from that school, and is known by almost all of my friends in my school because he posts stuff on Instagram for everyone to see. \n\nHe does not believe he is sick, which is the worst part. He believes that any medications we try to get him on are going to harm him, and refuses to take meds in any way. We had basically an intervention for him to get help, and he agreed to take meds since we basically forced him to. But he found ways around it by making himself throw up and hiding the pill. \n\nHe does not have a full time job, he\u2019s fixated essentially on the idea that he\u2019s still in high school. (Which explains why he likes younger girls, thinks that some of the jocks in my grade who know him are his friends, and still lives at home).\n\nHe heavily relies on weed and smokes it constantly, and he gets the money for that and food from us, and when he wants more than his daily allowance he gets violent, his psychosis acts up, and it all goes downhill yet again. When he gets drunk it\u2019s worse (like right now, I\u2019ll get to that). \n\nWe\u2019re trying to get social security for him, but even if we do, he cannot function independently in society with his illness. He\u2019s unable to save money or do anything involving planning from the future. \n\nMy parents still haven\u2019t given up on him though. They have been going to see counselors, reading books, doing hours on top of hours of research and they refuse to give up on him, which I really do respect and admire to some degree, as frustrating as being around him is. I can understand how from a parents point of view, they can\u2019t just kick him out to force him to live on his own when he is simply unable to do so. Yet they can\u2019t bring themselves to send him to a mental hospital for the rest of his life to simply watch life pass by. \n\nI am the youngest of 3, the middle brother is in college but home for the summer. I am a junior in high school and soon we are going to have to downsize our house for financial reasons, and we aren\u2019t going to be able to afford a house that he can live in with us, which is essentially the source of urgency for our situation. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what we can do with him, I don\u2019t even know if the brother I grew up with is still in him somewhere, but I am really getting hopeless. I cannot stand being around him, along with the paranoia and delusions he has a massive sense of grandiosity and self entitlement which just makes everything horrible.\n\nRight now, he is drunk from 7-8 beers he drank before breakfast, and is live streaming himself attempting to cut himself with a broken beer bottle on instagram. The police are on their way and I\u2019m just hiding in my room, waiting for this episode to pass, yet again. I have become horribly desensitized to all this which is also really disconcerting. \n\nMy daily life has become miserable, whether it\u2019s the screaming matches between him and my parents, or the multiple times we have to call the police, or when I get sent to the office at school for smelling of weed because he is constantly smoking in our driveway and I have to walk by him on my way to the car. \n\nSo I am at a loss for hope. I don\u2019t know where we can go from here. He\u2019s reached rock bottom on multiple occasions and he hasn\u2019t been able to recover as we hoped could possibly happen. So really, I am just wondering if any of you have any advice. I\u2019d love to find any options that we haven\u2019t considered, if there are any. Maybe by some miracle there\u2019s something obvious we haven\u2019t tried. But I just don\u2019t understand what we are supposed to do. And I don\u2019t have any idea how I can stand another moment of this"}, {"author": "gurneyhallack", "creation date": "2018-05-27 19:13:36", "selftext": "Hello.

I've heard that you could inherit mental illness from your parents(which would explain her behavior since my grandfather wasnt exactly in his right mind either).

Are there any precautions I need to take in order to keep it from happening."}, {"author": "dtree47", "creation date": "2018-05-27 23:43:10", "selftext": "So basically I have a friend who has been displaying, the best way I can describe it as, odd behavior for the past year or so and it seems like it\u2019s getting worse. Im thinking it\u2019s schizophrenia based of what I\u2019ve read online but I\u2019m not super well versed on the subject so maybe some of you can help me. \n\nFor starters he is 22 and I\u2019ve known him for about 6 years now as he is my best friends older brother. He and I aren\u2019t super close but I would definitely consider him a friend. When I met him he was someone I almost looked up to even tho he\u2019s just a year older than me. He was a completely normal guy, on the quiet side, but overall a chill dude. \n\nFor at least a year now I\u2019ve noticed a real change in him though, I won\u2019t be able to describe it all but I\u2019ll try to list and explain some behaviors of his. \n\nFor one I\u2019ve noticed he always over analyzing situations, he will question what I\u2019m thinking when I\u2019m just sitting there and often stare at me and others. He\u2019s also admitted in basically having thoughts that people are  out get him. He seems to be battling demons in his own head constantly. I can see him struggling internally, he can become very fidgety sometimes and it\u2019s hard to watch  because I know he\u2019s hurting. I\u2019ve tried to understand his thoughts but he is unable to describe why he feels certain ways, and if he does, it makes little sense. At this point I know something is off so I don\u2019t try and understand it or have him explain things to me. \n\nHe also has a very hard time comprehending the things people say and takes a very long time to respond. Even the simplest of things like \u201cdo you work tomorrow\u201d for example. He seems too focused on the things in his head to listen to what other people are saying. \n\nOther behaviors I\u2019ve noticed is his sleep schedule is all over the place, he will be up in the middle of the night and sleeping during the day pretty often. He lacks basically any motivation and does basically nothing besides work at a gym. Past interests of his he does not care about anymore. For example we used to talk about the NBA together and now doesn\u2019t follow it at all. He also used to be very into bodybuilding but he now doesn\u2019t seem to care about that either.\n\nHe has shared with others that he thinks fake acid is what did this to him but the acid he took was the same as a bunch others did including his own brother so while I don\u2019t think it was bad acid, I know that psychedelic drugs can bring out an underlying mental illness like schizophrenia. He has tripped on acid and mushrooms more than once but he no longer does. Also he smokes weed regularly and this only seems to makes him worse. Close ones to him have encouraged him to stop but he doesn\u2019t listen and smokes just about everyday still. \n\nJust last night I invited him to go to the bar to watch the Warriors vs Rockets game and he was talking to himself at times which is something I haven\u2019t noticed until now so I\u2019m not sure when he started doing this. He was also eyeing just about everyone who walked by, he was not watching the game at all even though he used to be a big NBA fan as I stated before.  At one point we had these two attractive females sit next to us and he would not stop looking at them the entire time and I could tell it was making them uncomfortable. He\u2019s very sexually frustrated and it seems his lack of success with women really gets to him. \n\nHis family has caught on to this all and I was hoping he would get some help but he seems to be getting worse. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re really taking it as seriously as they should be unfortunately.  Its getting to the point where it\u2019s hard to even hangout with him at all because of this. I\u2019m not sure what to do if anything but I\u2019m worried about his well-being because he only seems to be getting more and more disconnected from reality. \n"}, {"author": "gurneyhallack", "creation date": "2018-05-28 01:16:25", "selftext": "Hello. I am new here, but I thought I would share a a bit of my story. I came onto Reddit three months ago for the survivor subs. I have been in therapy five months, and it has helped a great deal. I never sought any help before, I had one bad experience with therapy a decade ago, and never went back, I didn't figure I was helpable. I am thirty seven, and have autism and PTSD, as well as the depression and anxiety, though those are getting better. When I was growing up, things were difficult. My father was a heroin addict and career criminal, and back then, my mother was the type of quiet girl who would not say shit. We moved thirty one times in my first eighteen years. When I was eight I was raped on five occasions by a man.\n\nIt was the point the bullying started to get really bad, they would punch, kick, throw stones, lock you inside things. I found a spot, a clearing in the woods, to hide. It was a tiny rural town, and I read detective stories, I figured out that the lack of detritus boys leave, little toys and whatnot, meant the other boys had not found this place. I went back to the spot maybe fifty or sixty times over that summer. He just showed up randomly five times, some farmer or something, I will never know. I would get so involved in my book, encyclopedia brown and Nancy Drew at that point, I did not notice him approaching until he was right there.\n\nThe first time, he only took off my clothes and fingered me. Afterword, he talked. About what a bitch his ex wife was, about some other boy he molested, about work. He made a very convincing case for why I should not tell, that my family would be broken up and us all placed in care, and this would happen more and be worse there. The second time he raped me orally. The third through fifth time were worse, he took me each way then, orally, from behind, on top like a girl, talking about his personal shit in between until he was ready again.\n\nThe fourth and fifth time he took pictures with an old polaroid camera. Get in this position and that, etc. I started acting out at home, though I never told anyone. I set a fire and I panicked, but I got it out. I broke some windows of a building, stole a pop from a store, and popped a blow up pool of a smaller girl. I still feel bad about that one, the way she cried. My parents knew the autism was a thing, though what it was, the name, they did not yet know. So they sent me to a live in hospital for six months. I was going to tell someone there, a kindly teacher figure, but the circumstances scared me. There were ten kids in our unit, and they treated most of us nice, but there was a girl, and they were not nice to her. Not unprofessional, just cold and robotic. She was bad, she would run away, grab the men sexually, she was eleven but it would take four grown men to restrain her safely. She used teeth and hands as claws.\n\nShe would tell trauma stories in hideous detail, laughing with a bitterness I have rarely heard in an adult. I was the only one she would talk to. I just got it, I mostly listened, I was still, and I never ever touched her. After six months, soon after I turned nine, they talked to me about going home. They left it up to me, but I was so excited, I did not think of her. When she heard, she locked herself in her room for a week. They needed all manner of threats to get her to come out and eat, at the end they simply refused to feed her if she did not come to the dining room.\n\nSo she did, and pushed a chair against a wall of the dining romm and stared at it, looking at nobody. I never saw her again. When I was eleven my uncle and cousin, who were thirty and nine, died in a housefire. Though our house was imperfect, the judge figured with a husband, wife and three kids, it was better for my surviving cousin, who was seven, to live with us rather than his mother, who was a kind lady, but a bad drunk. Dad treated him very badly, him and his brother had been very close, but he hated his wife, and they had rarely seen each other in the last five years. Dad seemed to take this out on the cousin.\n\nHe always treated him worse, assumed worse of him. He was a firm believer in spanking for me and my two younger sisters, but he rarely beat us. He beat him like a rag doll. This was made more so by the cousin being a fighter, a tough kid always getting into trouble. Later the year I was eleven, my father and an uncle burned our house down as an insurance scam. They got away with it, he sent us to stay the night at a friends house. Then called us out to see it, the whole family, to watch the fire trucks and the house burn.\n\nThe cousins hand in mine squeezing, his fear, is not something I can forget. After three years the cousin's mother got better, and he moved with her. Dad never let us see him again, and I only reconnected with him through facebook three years ago. My parents divorced at twelve, and my mother got with a prick who took emotional abuse to a new level. The bullying continued apace until fourteen, and the schools added zero tolerance policies. I was molested again when I was thirteen. We had a house on the beach, poor though we were, dad always seemed to be able to talk himself into good things, and I would walk up the beach miles, I liked long walks.\n\nIt was a public bathroom, it was very early morning, and there was nobody around. He simply shoved me in a stall, shoved his hands down my pants, and fiddled around. He told me that I was lucky I didn't get hard or he would have raped me, and left. When I was fifteen, dad got bad. He had bought us kids fine bedroom sets, fine beds, dressers, a television set, a super nintendo etc. One day we got home and everything was gone, replaced by the cheapest charity versions of what we had had.\n\nHe got worse, became suicidal. and sent us to live with an aunt, he went across the country to get clean. He didn't, and the aunt grew tired of us kids, getting rid of the one sister after two months, the other after four, and me after six. When I got to the big city my father and two sisters were living in, it was a gang riddled slum. He had had many people living in the house, my sisters will not talk about anything that happened in those months. There was nothing in the apartment, a mattress the girls shared, some clothes, a couch and coffee table, nothing else. My mother had moved to that side of the country since, and I phoned everybody.\n\nAbout a month after I got there, she kidnapped us technically to regain custody. We were living in that part of the country when I turned sixteen. That was the last time I was molested. I walked four miles to a mall, and was tired walking back and took a ride. The guy fiddled around, same as before, and called it fare for the ride. During those years there was constant partying, wild drug parties, in the house. There were other fires, suicides, and OD's. When I was eighteen, living back in the town I am in now, me and my father got an apartment together as adult roommates.\n\nDuring that my favorite uncle died in a drunken car crash, and a sweet old man I knew well, I sat in his house dozens of times to buy dope for dad, got stabbed to death over an attempt to steal twelve beers. That lasted four and a half years, but dad was a heroin addict, and one day I got up and he was stone dead. I was twenty two. I moved a hundred miles north six months later, to a town I had lived in and had a friend. I was OK for quite a few years, moved a lot, and poor, but I made friends, mostly by dealing grass, but still. At twenty eight I got a place with a friend. We lived together five years.\n\nThe first two were good, but the third got hard, and the last two were bad. He had schizophrenia, and I have autism. We started being gay, kinda. Spooning, kissing, hugging. But I could not be gay for him. I loved him, I tried to dredge up gay feelings sexually, looked at gay porn, but I just could not be that for him. The last two years it was awful. Hiding in rooms, banging on doors, constant yelling and sniping. threatening suicide, potential suicide pacts. In the last six months it got worse. The med changes stopped working, he started thinking people were coming into the apartment, watching in cars outside, hearing things.\n\nIt was when he started seeing UFO's I realized this was hurting him. I gave him two months notice, but he was so mad. He would not discuss me helping him get a place, just blew up. At the last two weeks he gpt scared of homelessness and begged me to find him a place. I did not know what to do. I have so little, with a bit more time it would have been easier, I found him a cottage in the nest town over where I would be living, but he did not want to leave the town because of his mother.\n\nSo all I could find him was a room in a boarding house. It was an awful place. We kept talking for a month, but at that point, he was at his mothers when I visited, I visited every day, taking the link bus between towns. He told me never to contact him again, not to cry in front of his mother, it was over. When someone says that, decent society says to obey that, so I did not contact him. A month after that, he had pushed a dresser in front of the door of his room in the boarding house, and was on his meds, and set himself on fire sleeping.\n\nHe lived, but him and another man were badly burned.After a month he was released from the hospital, and I did visit his mothers once more. She said she had always liked me, took my contact info, but said he would never contact me. She was right, he never did. After that, I began drinking quite heavily. I do not know if the drinking caused the memories from childhood that I thought I had dealt with or what. Over the next four years of everyday drunkenness I fucked up everything. Lost most of my friendships, became a sad whining idiot.\n\nAt that point, a year ago I jumped off a bridge. That was the point I decided to get help. Things are getting better, addiction counseling for ten months, therapy for five. I am two credits from finishing highschool, getting my drivers license, got my first part time job. Three weeks ago I was layed off from my job until September, and my therapist is taking literally nothing until then, with both of us simply assuming and hoping I do in fact get my job back.

They are very obvious and they both sound internal but also quite surround as if it's coming from behind me to the left for example. \n\nI've never had any history of mental illness, so even the slightest bit is unfamiliar for me but I do have a strong interest in understanding them. An old friend of mine has schizophrenia and the details he told me about the voices themselves sound very similar to mine however there is one big difference (that leads me to believe I DON'T have it), and that is I can't understand what they are saying. As a non dutch speaker, the voices sound incredible like dutch. I can't make out a single word. The weird thing is they follow the vocal tones of common voice formats. For example the other night it was a pretty deep voice that was talking exactly like a news host, with the odd emphasis (watch the news and you'll understand). Another time it was like reading a list, and sometimes it's like regular conversation. Sometimes it's overlapping. I've heard of voices in your head haven't heard of anything like this before. I'm not depressed or suffer anxiety, I'm not on any medications and I live a healthy lifestyle, plenty of sleep good diet etc... \n\nRight now it's not causing me any harm or hassle, I can still sleep, it doesn't interfere with my life, so I'm not too fussed about it, but I'm curious if anyone else either has this or knows anything about it?

I'm going to start from the start my best friend had been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts and before he had the suicidal thoughts he told me he had a crush on me which struck me off guard and at the time I hadn't even thought about dating anyone anytime soon. So I brought him down and said I was flattered but I couldnt. Which then a week or 2 down the track he had suicidal thoughts and had set a date and I managed to save him from doing it by calling his mum. He has thanked me since for it. After another month I started having feelings for him and thinking about how hard it would be been to continue life without him and a little further down the track he met someone off reddit and started dating her after knowing her for just under a week. Currently he tells me hes the happiest hes been in ages but the issue I have is she has some mental issues like schizophrenia which does worry him when she has episodes to the point he starts crying. Which makes me feel really bad. I did tell him how I felt about just under a month down the track. He didnt express how he really felt about me saying that. We sort of brushed it off and continued to talk as normal but I cant shake this feeling and its caused me to feel anxiety, regret and jealousy of this person. We have been friends for over 7 years and we talk about anything and everything and these new feelings I have I find super uncomfortable to have and I guess I feel sad they wont really go anywhere.\n\nEdit: Also since she has some mental issues she requires alot more of his time. So we went from talking on voice chat everyday for hours to 4 or 5 times a month for an hour or so. I'm finding this change hard as well as I didnt realise how much he influenced my life in such a huge way.\nAny day that im not talking to him causes me pain.

I would like to know more people that have a similar situation too.\n\nIm 23 and have been diagnosed with \"just psychosis\" to schizoaffective to schizophrenia. This started at 14 years old.

Risperdone, haloperidol, clozapine, CBD oil, vitamins, etc. Its been a rough ride but things are now narrowed down to schizophrenia and some other mood and PTSD disorders.\n\nI am now 1 year and 1 month off of all meds. I completed a full DBT course before tapering off, and enjoyed the group sessions at the end too which is strange for me. This medication decision was encouraged by my psych of 3 years \\(who was not the best\\) and my therapist of 4 years \\(who is really good\\). I have multiple other diagnoses and health problems that led to this decision. The medications made me miserable physically and mentally and i have had pretty bad reactions to some. My therapist noticed i did better with skills and coping and grounding when i went a week or 2 without meds \\(due to no money\\). I am glad it happened, but now i worry more and more these last months that i should be back on meds.\n\nIm not even on antidepressants now,i just do therapy once a week. Now though, i doubt myself constantly. I am not getting \"worse\" exactly, but i am experiencing more symptoms. My hallucinations and delusions do interfere with my life but it seems marginal to me. I am coping and living still. I just change my clothes or avoid 1 food for a day, or seem really dazed for a while. I have my little daily rituals of checking the house and my pets and i have a stable relationship so i cant complain. I actually handle leaving the house more often and i enjoy it at times too.\n\nMy therapist says she does not see any immediate need to be back on medicine, but my social life is absolute zero and im having more intrusive voices and beliefs and primal back\\-of\\-the\\-brain feelings.

I feel like i am stagnant and that other people see me as worse or bad and i cant tell what is just my brain saying it or what is true. Everyone around me says i am better and nicer, but i was taught that experiencing any of my symptoms was a \"warning sign\" that i am deteriorating. Im afraid that if i dont start medication again then i will be almost untreatable.\n\nAll in all, i would like to know if anyone else struggles with this kind of \"impostor syndrome\" experience after being unmedicated for large amounts of time. And if anyone else out there does better without medicine, how do you balance your life effectively?

When I was eighteen, living back in the town I am in now, me and my father got an apartment together as adult roommates.\n\nDuring that my favorite uncle died in a drunken car crash, and a sweet old man I knew well, I sat in his house dozens of times to buy dope for dad, got stabbed to death over an attempt to steal twelve beers. That lasted four and a half years, but dad was a heroin addict, and one day I got up and he was stone dead. I was twenty two. I moved a hundred miles north six months later, to a town I had lived in and had a friend. I was OK for quite a few years, moved a lot, and poor, but I made friends, mostly by dealing grass, but still. At twenty eight I got a place with a friend. We lived together five years.\n\nThe first two were good, but the third got hard, and the last two were bad. He had schizophrenia, and I have autism. We started being gay, kinda. Spooning, kissing, hugging. But I could not be gay for him. I loved him, I tried to dredge up gay feelings sexually, looked at gay porn, but I just could not be that for him. The last two years it was awful. Hiding in rooms, banging on doors, constant yelling and sniping. threatening suicide, potential suicide pacts. In the last six months it got worse. The med changes stopped working, he started thinking people were coming into the apartment, watching in cars outside, hearing things.\n\nIt was when he started seeing UFO's I realized this was hurting him. I gave him two months notice, but he was so mad. He would not discuss me helping him get a place, just blew up. At the last two weeks he gpt scared of homelessness and begged me to find him a place. I did not know what to do. I have so little, with a bit more time it would have been easier, I found him a cottage in the nest town over where I would be living, but he did not want to leave the town because of his mother.\n\nSo all I could find him was a room in a boarding house. It was an awful place. We kept talking for a month, but at that point, he was at his mothers when I visited, I visited every day, taking the link bus between towns. He told me never to contact him again, not to cry in front of his mother, it was over. When someone says that, decent society says to obey that, so I did not contact him. A month after that, he had pushed a dresser in front of the door of his room in the boarding house, and was on his meds, and set himself on fire sleeping.\n\nHe lived, but him and another man were badly burned.After a month he was released from the hospital, and I did visit his mothers once more. She said she had always liked me, took my contact info, but said he would never contact me. She was right, he never did. After that, I began drinking quite heavily. I do not know if the drinking caused the memories from childhood that I thought I had dealt with or what. Over the next four years of everyday drunkenness I fucked up everything. Lost most of my friendships, became a sad whining idiot.\n\nAt that point, a year ago I jumped off a bridge. That was the point I decided to get help. Things are getting better, addiction counseling for ten months, therapy for five. I am two credits from finishing highschool, getting my drivers license, got my first part time job. Three weeks ago I was layed off from my job until September, and my therapist is taking literally nothing until then, with both of us simply assuming and hoping I do in fact get my job back. Anyway, this is long, but I wanted to tell the basic core of my story.

The stuff, it really does taint you, make you a bad person. So I am going to put my story here. I do not know why, with this preface and any addendum, it is quite long, doubtful anybody actually reads it. Or cares. But this is my shitty, meaningless story.\n\nHello. I am new here, but I thought I would share a a bit of my story. I came onto Reddit three months ago for the survivor subs. I have been in therapy five months, and it has helped a great deal. I never sought any help before, I had one bad experience with therapy a decade ago, and never went back, I didn't figure I was helpable. I am thirty seven, and have autism and PTSD, as well as the depression and anxiety, though those are getting better. When I was growing up, things were difficult. My father was a heroin addict and career criminal, and back then, my mother was the type of quiet girl who would not say shit. We moved thirty one times in my first eighteen years. When I was eight I was raped on five occasions by a man.\n\nIt was the point the bullying started to get really bad, they would punch, kick, throw stones, lock you inside things. I found a spot, a clearing in the woods, to hide. It was a tiny rural town, and I read detective stories, I figured out that the lack of detritus boys leave, little toys and whatnot, meant the other boys had not found this place. I went back to the spot maybe fifty or sixty times over that summer. He just showed up randomly five times, some farmer or something, I will never know. I would get so involved in my book, encyclopedia brown and Nancy Drew at that point, I did not notice him approaching until he was right there.\n\nThe first time, he only took off my clothes and fingered me. Afterword, he talked. About what a bitch his ex wife was, about some other boy he molested, about work. He made a very convincing case for why I should not tell, that my family would be broken up and us all placed in care, and this would happen more and be worse there. The second time he raped me orally. The third through fifth time were worse, he took me each way then, orally, from behind, on top like a girl, talking about his personal shit in between until he was ready again.\n\nThe fourth and fifth time he took pictures with an old polaroid camera. Get in this position and that, etc. I started acting out at home, though I never told anyone. I set a fire and I panicked, but I got it out. I broke some windows of a building, stole a pop from a store, and popped a blow up pool of a smaller girl. I still feel bad about that one, the way she cried. My parents knew the autism was a thing, though what it was, the name, they did not yet know. So they sent me to a live in hospital for six months. I was going to tell someone there, a kindly teacher figure, but the circumstances scared me. There were ten kids in our unit, and they treated most of us nice, but there was a girl, and they were not nice to her. Not unprofessional, just cold and robotic. She was bad, she would run away, grab the men sexually, she was eleven but it would take four grown men to restrain her safely. She used teeth and hands as claws.\n\nShe would tell trauma stories in hideous detail, laughing with a bitterness I have rarely heard in an adult. I was the only one she would talk to. I just got it, I mostly listened, I was still, and I never ever touched her. After six months, soon after I turned nine, they talked to me about going home. They left it up to me, but I was so excited, I did not think of her. When she heard, she locked herself in her room for a week. They needed all manner of threats to get her to come out and eat, at the end they simply refused to feed her if she did not come to the dining room.\n\nSo she did, and pushed a chair against a wall of the dining romm and stared at it, looking at nobody. I never saw her again. When I was eleven my uncle and cousin, who were thirty and nine, died in a housefire. Though our house was imperfect, the judge figured with a husband, wife and three kids, it was better for my surviving cousin, who was seven, to live with us rather than his mother, who was a kind lady, but a bad drunk. Dad treated him very badly, him and his brother had been very close, but he hated his wife, and they had rarely seen each other in the last five years. Dad seemed to take this out on the cousin.\n\nHe always treated him worse, assumed worse of him. He was a firm believer in spanking for me and my two younger sisters, but he rarely beat us. He beat him like a rag doll. This was made more so by the cousin being a fighter, a tough kid always getting into trouble. Later the year I was eleven, my father and an uncle burned our house down as an insurance scam. They got away with it, he sent us to stay the night at a friends house. Then called us out to see it, the whole family, to watch the fire trucks and the house burn.\n\nThe cousins hand in mine squeezing, his fear, is not something I can forget. After three years the cousin's mother got better, and he moved with her. Dad never let us see him again, and I only reconnected with him through facebook three years ago. My parents divorced at twelve, and my mother got with a prick who took emotional abuse to a new level. The bullying continued apace until fourteen, and the schools added zero tolerance policies. I was molested again when I was thirteen. We had a house on the beach, poor though we were, dad always seemed to be able to talk himself into good things, and I would walk up the beach miles, I liked long walks.\n\nIt was a public bathroom, it was very early morning, and there was nobody around. He simply shoved me in a stall, shoved his hands down my pants, and fiddled around. He told me that I was lucky I didn't get hard or he would have raped me, and left. When I was fifteen, dad got bad. He had bought us kids fine bedroom sets, fine beds, dressers, a television set, a super nintendo etc. One day we got home and everything was gone, replaced by the cheapest charity versions of what we had had.\n\nHe got worse, became suicidal. and sent us to live with an aunt, he went across the country to get clean. He didn't, and the aunt grew tired of us kids, getting rid of the one sister after two months, the other after four, and me after six. When I got to the big city my father and two sisters were living in, it was a gang riddled slum. He had had many people living in the house, my sisters will not talk about anything that happened in those months. There was nothing in the apartment, a mattress the girls shared, some clothes, a couch and coffee table, nothing else. My mother had moved to that side of the country since, and I phoned everybody.\n\nAbout a month after I got there, she kidnapped us technically to regain custody. We were living in that part of the country when I turned sixteen. That was the last time I was molested. I walked four miles to a mall, and was tired walking back and took a ride. The guy fiddled around, same as before, and called it fare for the ride. During those years there was constant partying, wild drug parties, in the house. There were other fires, suicides, and OD's. When I was eighteen, living back in the town I am in now, me and my father got an apartment together as adult roommates.\n\nDuring that my favorite uncle died in a drunken car crash, and a sweet old man I knew well, I sat in his house dozens of times to buy dope for dad, got stabbed to death over an attempt to steal twelve beers. That lasted four and a half years, but dad was a heroin addict, and one day I got up and he was stone dead. I was twenty two. I moved a hundred miles north six months later, to a town I had lived in and had a friend. I was OK for quite a few years, moved a lot, and poor, but I made friends, mostly by dealing grass, but still. At twenty eight I got a place with a friend. We lived together five years.\n\nThe first two were good, but the third got hard, and the last two were bad. He had schizophrenia, and I have autism. We started being gay, kinda. Spooning, kissing, hugging. But I could not be gay for him. I loved him, I tried to dredge up gay feelings sexually, looked at gay porn, but I just could not be that for him. The last two years it was awful. Hiding in rooms, banging on doors, constant yelling and sniping. threatening suicide, potential suicide pacts. In the last six months it got worse. The med changes stopped working, he started thinking people were coming into the apartment, watching in cars outside, hearing things.\n\nIt was when he started seeing UFO's I realized this was hurting him. I gave him two months notice, but he was so mad. He would not discuss me helping him get a place, just blew up. At the last two weeks he gpt scared of homelessness and begged me to find him a place. I did not know what to do. I have so little, with a bit more time it would have been easier, I found him a cottage in the nest town over where I would be living, but he did not want to leave the town because of his mother.\n\nSo all I could find him was a room in a boarding house. It was an awful place. We kept talking for a month, but at that point, he was at his mothers when I visited, I visited every day, taking the link bus between towns. He told me never to contact him again, not to cry in front of his mother, it was over. When someone says that, decent society says to obey that, so I did not contact him. A month after that, he had pushed a dresser in front of the door of his room in the boarding house, and was on his meds, and set himself on fire sleeping.\n\nHe lived, but him and another man were badly burned.After a month he was released from the hospital, and I did visit his mothers once more. She said she had always liked me, took my contact info, but said he would never contact me. She was right, he never did. After that, I began drinking quite heavily. I do not know if the drinking caused the memories from childhood that I thought I had dealt with or what. Over the next four years of everyday drunkenness I fucked up everything. Lost most of my friendships, became a sad whining idiot.\n\nAt that point, a year ago I jumped off a bridge. That was the point I decided to get help. Things are getting better, addiction counseling for ten months, therapy for five. I am two credits from finishing highschool, getting my drivers license, got my first part time job. Three weeks ago I was layed off from my job until September, and my therapist is taking literally nothing until then, with both of us simply assuming and hoping I do in fact get my job back. Anyway, this is long, but I wanted to tell the basic core of my story. Thank you so very much to anybody who reads this.\n\nIn any case, I go to therapy in half an hour. I feel pretty bad right now, and the bad thoughts keep spinning. But no doubt I will be fine. I will keep working. But I cannot keep a false confidence forever. If the goals we, the social worker and therapist and I, talk about, are bullshit to give me hope, so I can be a less depressive complaining person, stop bothering others in my life, it worked. I no longer talk about my sadness or anger with anybody, and can now keep my pain inside. \n\nI have been helped by therapy. But I am gaining a sneaking suspicion that this is they core of it. Learn how to shut up about your personal problems. Which is fine, it makes sense and is right. People really should not have to have you put your stuff on them. But I do know if I do something to myself in the future, all this therapy stuff has taught me that. If you truly feel that way, people would prefer I just do it quietly and be done with it.

I've known Pete for about 4 years now, and he use to be a promising student/young man. Once he started showing signs of...well, something not right, was when he'd started to believe he was being followed by the CIA/FBI. He'd believe a pickup tuck with fishing poles was a listening van, that people in suites were agents, and that he knows some highly sensitive information about Government programs. \n\nOn top of that, he can't stay in one place for too long. While he's been with my Dad and Step-mom for years, he'll constantly try to lease an apartment here and there, staying for only a night or two, and returning back to the house, wasting huge amounts of money (which he received from an inheritance from a deceased relative).\n\nTalking to him is another experience. Usually it's the exact same phrases and patterns every time I try to start a conversation with Pete. He speaks well-enough to sound intelligent, using vocabulary one wouldn't normally use in everyday conversations, and despite this uses the same patterns of conversation most the time. For example, I'll ask \"How are ya feeling?\", and he'll respond \"Good, you?\" every single time. Even when I give answers other than good, like tired, or bored, or excited, etc, he'll only ever use the same few words. And when I ask about some of his odd behaviors, such as laughing at random around the house while looking at nothing, he'll say it was just something funny he remembered, or make up that he saw/read something funny when I know all he's doing is starring at a blank wall or tv screen. He'll be doing nothing but occasionally burst out laughing, and comes up with a lie or excuse to cover up this odd behavior. \n\nIn fact, anytime we address medication, treatment, or his illness he'll get defensive and deny it. It's not that we try to judge him about it but are concerned for him ending up homeless as he can't hold down a job, and hasn't worked for 7 years. His thought process is chaotic as he can't seem to make a decision and stick to it, so we worry if he doesn't get appropriate medication, or even accept that he has an illness, he'll end up on the streets. \n\nAs of now it feels like there's some subtle resentment Pete has for me, and barely says a word. He's back on the stage of fleeing to some other city for a day or two maybe, if he doesn't immediately turn back and come home the same day. What would you do to try and reach out to someone like this? \n\n\nTL;DR: I don't know how to communicate with someone 'supposedly' afflicted with schizophrenia when they can't accept they have an illness, or recognize their odd behaviors, or see that they need to start working to become independent.

Before this day I hadn't missed a single dose of my Seroquel, but it had been a week since last I took my as-needed night Zyprexa. After the walk I'll tell you about stuff had escalated to the point where I refused to take meds, thinking the devils would better access my mind if I did.\n\nI decided later on that day I had to go for a walk, to walk away from the antennas the devils used to read my mind. Everything in metal is an antenna, and they use radiowaves to read my mind + attempt to control it. I brought a scalpel handle and scalpel blades with me. I was wearing two open hoodies, short shorts, pantyhose, and thigh high stockings. I cut while walking, on my thighs between the stockings and my shorts. I cut *a lot*, and one of them was the deepest I ever cut (considering I never have a self harming \"session\" without cutting down to fat tissue, I guess that says enough). Eventually the entirety of the front of my thighs was covered in blood, my stockings were soaked in blood, even my shoes were covered in blood. In my mind, I was sacrificing blood to the gods between the layers of the world, so they'd protect me against the devils between the layers. I gave blood to the gods back in March, too, and the stuff about all metal being radio antennas started in April. \n\nConsidering I was walking by a trafficked road covered in blood with a scalpel in my hand and most certainly not in a straight line while singing and talking to myself and laughing, someone obviously called the police. The police came, I crossed the road and tried to walk away, they ran after me and told me to drop the scalpel. I didn't, so I got pepper sprayed. An ambulance came after the police had me sit down on a nearby bench and started trying to bandage my thighs while I still couldn't see from the pepper spray. I screamed becaused they touched me while I couldn't see and kicked in all directions from where I was sitting.\n\nBoth EMTs and both police officers surrounded me when they walked me into the hospital ER. I got put in a room to wait for a doctor with both police there to watch me. I tried to leave because I had been around the same antennas too long, so they grabbed me and held me down till the doctor arrived. I had 15 stitches. When he tried to bandage it I freaked out and jumped away and curled up in a corner, saying nothing but \"tap tap slide\" (I kept saying this basically constantly from that point on, to protect me from the radio signals). They had me bandage it myself. After that police escorted me to the acute psych ward, I had no choice and got hospitalised on a coercive paragraph.\n\nCouple days later and they moved me to a different ward, let's call it U. I cut more while at U and needed more stitches. I used the blood to paint \"tap tap slide\" in blood on the wall. I did nothing but laugh, play with the blood, and say \"tap tap slide\" while one of the nurses bandaged it to keep it covered before we went back down to the ER.\n\nLater the same day something snapped in me. I freaked out that I couldn't give more blood for protection, and started pacing in my room at the ward and kicking the closet instead. I said nothing but \"tap tap slide\", did nothing but scratch off skin on my arm and kick the closet. The report from the decision to use coercion says \"the patient has no incoming channels. Communication has been attempted but it is futile\" in one part. I can kick pretty hard, and I kick with decent technique. The staff didn't dare to enter my room, they just stood outside it. Police were called again. \n\n3 police officers came into my room. The first one had a shield. He used the shield to push me up against the wall while the two others grabbed me. I remember one of them yelled \"watch the legs!!\" to the other two. They threw me around and got on top of me, handcuffed me, and dragged me into the police car with my arms bent all the way back. They took me back down to a different acute ward. The U ward doesn't have restraints, so I assume that's why. \n\nThree people kept holding me down on a bench at the acute ward, one held my head as well cause I kept trying to bite. They didn't take off the cuffs until there were like 6-8 people in the room to hold me and move me to the bed with belt restraints and restrain me. Belts around each ankle, belt around rib cage with wrists attached in belts to it, belt over chest and under upperarms. They also injected Zyprexa into my thigh while I was in the belts. I fought them so hard I have wounds on my ankles from it and the whole bed moved. Through all of this I did nothing but say \"tap tap slide\". All I could think was that now, the devils had won. The devils had won. I was so scared. I was so scared the devils would make me do what the robot people made me do. They made me touch myself sexually and it hurt so much, more than when a real human raped me. I was so scared the devils would make that happen again. And all I could think was that the devils had won, all I could do was fight the restraints and say \"tap tap slide\".\n\nThey had me take Zyprexa every night from that point on, taking minutes every night to talk me into doing it and staying with me after while I freaked out over it. It started helping slowly. Slowly talking got easier. On day 5 or 6 in the ward I almost entirely stopped saying and doing \"tap tap slide\". Day 8 now. I'm much better. I know it's delusions, but I still have them. They won't discharge me quite yet, but sometime this week I'll probably be moved again, either to U or to a different ward (hoping the other one, cause that one's an open ward). I'm just confused, and exhausted, and hurt. This whole episode hurt. A lot. \n\nI just wanted to share I guess."}, {"author": "420_throwaway35", "creation date": "2018-05-29 21:21:48", "selftext": "You can check my post history for a more detailed description of these episodes, but here's a summarized version:\n\n\nI uses to be a heavy weed smoker and it helped control my anxiety (im dxed with anxiety, depression and adhd) but have since stopped due to several episodes of what appear to be panic attacks initally triggered from an interaction between weed and wellbutrin. These panic attacks were kind of strange though- classic in pretty much every way (heart racing, thinking i was dying/having a heart attack, shaking, sense of impending doom, ect) except for one thing, I would have extremely irrational/disorganized delusional thoughts every time. Sometimes I would think they were true for a short time (few-15 minutes) but its hard to tell if i believed them or was simply extremely scared of them being true, due to the fact that my thoughts were so disorganized and the fact I would switch between \"delusions\" every few minutes. The first time was the worst, I was completely out of touch with reality, but subsequent times i would sometimes be able to \"talk myself out of it\" or recognize i was being crazy. I could communicate clearly with others during these episodes and did not mention my delusional thoughts. I have since completely discontinued smoking. I have not had an episode like this while sober, aside from a couple instances that felt like the onset of a panic attack that I was able to quickly talk myself down from (no weird thoughts, just that good old impending doom feeling)\n\n\nLet me preface this by the fact that i am seeing a psychiatrist about this asap (just moved), but i really need some reassurance/opinions during the interim because im scared. Since these episodes ive become extremely anxious that they are evidence that im going to go crazy/develop a psychotic disorder later in life. I dont have any family history of psychosis or schizophrenia and like I said this has never happened sober. I did some research which made me even more worried because I read that people who have drug induced psychotic episodes have a 41% chance of developing schizophrenia later in life. The catch is they only studied episodes lasting 2+ days and mine never lasted more than 2-3 hours, and i had no psychotic symptoms other than delusion. So i may just be freaking myself out over nothing and being stupid, but im still really fucking scared. I just needed to talk to other people about this who also have anxiety because my loved ones don't seem to understand.

Although we know quite a bit about it, it\u2019s still not that well understood,\u201d said Steven Silverstein, professor of psychiatry at [Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School](https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/) and director of research at [Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care](http://ubhc.rutgers.edu/) \\(UBHC\\), who designed the study. \u201cOur study should help generate further research into developing a test that clinicians \u2013 like psychologists, psychiatrists or nurses \u2013 can use in their offices to diagnose, treat and monitor the condition of people with schizophrenia.\u201d\n\nLooking at biomarkers in the eye as a way to understand psychiatric disorders is a new field of study.\n\n\u201cSince the retina is part of the nervous system, what is happening in the retina is likely reflective of what is occurring in the brain,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cFor example, we know that certain changes in the retina, like thinning tissue \\[due to cell loss\\] or weakening electrical activity, occur alongside loss of brain tissue and reduced brain activity in patients with neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease. We and other researchers are now investigating whether retinal changes are related to brain structure and function changes in schizophrenia.\u201d\n\nIn the just\\-published study, the researchers evaluated 50 participants: 25 with schizophrenia and 25 with no diagnosed psychiatric disorder. In the test, the participants closed one eye and placed the other against the RETeval device, which flashed 10 to 20 white or colored lights of various intensity against a white or colored background. A tiny skin electrode was placed on the skin under the eye to record the retina\u2019s electrical activity. The participants were tested in normal light and after sitting in the dark for 10 minutes to assess activity in different types of retinal cells. Most individual tests were completed within two minutes.\n\n\u201cSince many of our participants were experiencing severe psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, we wanted to use a test that was as noninvasive and quick as possible,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\n\u201cWhile the portable device clearly distinguished people with schizophrenia from those without a psychiatric diagnosis, it\u2019s too soon to call this a diagnostic tool,\u201d said lead author Docia Demmin, a graduate assistant in UBHC\u2019s [Division of Schizophrenia Research](http://ubhc.rutgers.edu/dsr/) and a doctoral student in [Rutgers Department of Psychology](https://psych.rutgers.edu/). \u201cHowever, since every prior study has found that people with schizophrenia exhibit reduced retinal wave forms and slowed retinal responses, our research shows that we closing in on an accurate test that is faster, less invasive, inexpensive and more accessible to patients.\u201d\n\nSee a photo of the device in operation here:   \nhttp://go.rutgers.edu/qpuuzdg8"}, {"author": "Schiz1717", "creation date": "2018-05-30 20:09:04", "selftext": "https://themighty.com/2018/05/schizophrenic-nyc-schizophrenia-helping-others/"}, {"author": "antkings", "creation date": "2018-05-30 20:38:23", "selftext": "i am in an partial hospitalization program for my PTSD and year-long psychosis. recently, I\u2019ve made a new friend here. he has schizophrenia. he does not share his world or perceptions with the group, only with me. he is very deeply believing in the delusion that he lives. i love him incredibly and want to be the best, most supportive person i can be. what is the best way that i can help him, or the best way to be his friend? i don\u2019t know if i should try to help him understand his delusions, emotions, or just be his friend and \u201cplay along\u201d with them. sometimes he can become really incoherent with the way he talks and the way his thoughts wander.

I am 22 years old and life is stressful with college and family. Where do I begin? I was diagnose with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Wow, those are a lot of problems. I struggle to commit suicide because I have a twin brother and an older sister, their combine love basically keeps me going at this point. I also have a group of friends who I can talk to on a personal level. I bite my nails constantly, it is one of my bad habits. I used to get bullied at school but now that I am in college, bullying is almost nonexistent (thank god). Anyways, college has been stressful because of the work load. My major is computer science and gpa is 3.1. Basically after the first semester, I do well but on the second half, I run out of steam. How can I maintain stamina through out the entire year? I guess my best solution is to go to the gym and get rip at my college campus. \n...\nNow here is my problem with family. When I was young, I always had a problem of people putting me down. My dad is a jerk but I still have to respect him. I used to get beat so often that I became a  living zombie. I try to build a father and son relationship with him, but this man is stiff as a brick. I eventually get good mornings from him during the daytime, but thats about it.\nMy mom loves me and my two sibling a lot. However, when it comes to parenting (advice giving) it's abysmal. I love my mom a lot but my god she has got to leave her mother's wing. I think she is 51 years old and still lives with her mother who is 74 currently. At some point in time folks, you got to leave your parents wing.\n...\nMy grandmother is the chef of the family. The house we live in her house. Now, there is a huge problem when the house you live in is run by a dictator. She is manipulative, ignorant, and a mosquito on my mood. I try to show as much affection to her as possible but I feel like all I am doing is massaging her ego. This is my mom's mother. The two of them are extremely close.  My mom sleeps in grandma's room and not in the room with her husband (the man she supposedly married) but I digress. My dad constantly boast about how she is a horrible parent. He is right. Because the next person on the list is her son or in other words my uncle. \n....\nMy uncle lives with us now. I think he is 50 years old. He had run into some trouble with the law multiple times and had to serve jail time. He also has 4 children with two different women and unemployed. He failed to pay child support. Now this man, hate, and I mean HATE his sister (my mother) and his mother (my grandmother) for numerous reasons, that I am not going to get into because its such a long list of bull shit. Anyways, this man loves degrading my mom and if you have an opposing viewpoint he would degrade you too. We got in a fight, which wasn't much of a fight because I easily got overpowered. I will admit, I was stupid to confront him but that's not all, the man that self invited himself into our house put an order of protection on me and my mom. I feel bad for the stress that is putting on my grandmother. We have to go to family court. I wasn't completely truthful on the description for the order of protection. To be honest it was my mom who forced me out of bed to file the order of protection. This stress draining on the body, mind, and soul. The sad thing about it, I put myself in their death triangle. \n....\nMy cousin and my family obviously shared some bad blood. He refers\nmy family members as pigs and bitches, lowest of the low. This didn't\nreally bothered me at first, however he would call me on a daily basis just to know what I am doing. I didn't mind at first but it got to the point where he would dictate how I should live my life. If there was one word I had to think of that would explain my relationship in one word, it would have to be suffocating. It felt as if the way how I lived my life wasn't up to his standards. I am an introvert, he is an extrovert to the extreme. Sadly, we live in a world where people have all the answers for others but none for themselves.\n...\nI am far from my perfect self. I took my anger out on social media, and lost a friend and family. It just felt so addictive to expel all that anger, however it almost seemed as if I was trying to look for pity from other people or someone who can answer my cry for help. I hate being angry because it not only hurt yourself but those around you. Perhaps I should just go to a homeless shelter just to get some peace of mind. I really want to have my own place for myself, work with a big tech company and have a dog (helps with depression).\nAnyways what is your thoughts on my situation?                                 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "}, {"author": "Angryhotguy", "creation date": "2018-05-31 18:44:03", "selftext": "I am schizoaffective with the mood disorder being major clinical depression.

She just tells me to think better thoughts and improve my life. She doesn't delve into the deep root causes of my problems.\n\nI met a girl online in 2012 who I fell in love with but she's poor and can't afford a phone. She stopped talking to me for a few years, reconnected last two years ago and fell off of the face of the Earth.

I think that will help with my memory, focus and overall well being.
